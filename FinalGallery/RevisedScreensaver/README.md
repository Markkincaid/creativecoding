This is a screen saver I created for my creative coding class. It was created in october of 2019 so I decided to go with a holloween theme. Most of how to do alot of the p5js tricks I used can be found in creative coding videos. And anything learned or taken elsewhere is commented in the sketch.js file itself. All the pngs in the repository are the pictures I used in the program.


Revision:
For our final project we were tasked to pick and revise four of our projects. I chose this project because I felt as if it had the most room for improvement amongst all my work, not saying it was the worst but I felt that it had left quite a bit on the table. As for the revision process, I started by asking all my friends how they thought to improve this project. After filtering all thier crazy ideas that would take weeks to code, I came to a realization that they had all mentioned the empty space in the project. so I added two more images to the code. A scarecrow that I find very cool because he blends into the background and gets revealed as more stars appear, and a house that adds color and depth to the screensaver. I felt that these two changes were best because they didnt add any more load, which in my opinion wouldve made the piece too much for a screensaver. overall I feel much more proud of this piece afterward.
