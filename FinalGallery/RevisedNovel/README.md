This is my code for my creative coding class assignment. For this assignment we were required to make a novel that generates 50,000 words. Currently my novel generates around 100,000 words but is capable of much more. The code uses some AI like mechanics thanks to the library Markovify. Markovify reads a file (in my case the shrek movie script), and based on the sentance tendancies generates new sentances. As a glamorous touch around every 500 words I generated a piece of ascii art for the chapters. I had a lot of fun making this, and actually already had quite a few people interested in it so I tried to keep this project more clean and actually like a novel, so it is nothing crazy.

The following files are included:

Shrek.py: the python code that generates the novel.

Shrek.txt: the shrek movie script the code uses.

Shreknovel.txt: a sample novel that has already been generated.


Revision: 
Added a new novel option
Included a combo of the shrek and bee movie script for this option.

This was my proudest project of the semester, and was definitely the most fun for me to work on. I chose to revise this project and put it in this gallery, because I wouldnt feel like I was doing myself justice if I didnt include this project in my final gallery. As for the process, I was kind of dry on ideas for this project since I exhausted them while making it, so I took my Professors Advice and just added a novel option so It takes from larger files and gives more unique results.
