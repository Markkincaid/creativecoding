This is my code for my creative coding class assignment. For this assignment we were required to make a novel that generates 50,000 words. Currently my novel generates around 100,000 words but is capable of much more. The code uses some AI like mechanics thanks to the library Markovify. Markovify reads a file (in my case the shrek movie script), and based on the sentance tendancies generates new sentances. As a glamorous touch around every 500 words I generated a piece of ascii art for the chapters. I had a lot of fun making this, and actually already had quite a few people interested in it so I tried to keep this project more clean and actually like a novel, so it is nothing crazy.

The following files are included:

Shrek.py: the python code that generates the novel.

Shrek.txt: the shrek movie script the code uses.

Shreknovel.txt: a sample novel that has already been generated.


Revision: 
Added a new novel option
Included a combo of the shrek and bee movie script for this option.

This was another project I was extremely proud of. This project definitely expanded my knowledge of Python and its vast amount of libraries. As for the Revision process, I wanted to add more variety in the generation. In order to accomplish this, I created a file that had both the bee movie script and the shrek movie script combined. then I had the Markovify make sentences, and printed these results every other chapter. This led to much more variety and a much better result. I also updated the code to run on python3.
