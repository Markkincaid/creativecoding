"A lot of good tricks.
"All I need is a reindeer..." The Grinch looked around.
"And NOW!" grinned the Grinch, "I will stuff up the tree!"
"And they're hanging their stockings!" he snarled with a sneer,
"Belly stars are no longer in style," said McBean.
"But I like to be here.
"Did you have any fun?
"Do you hear!
"Good grief!" groaned the ones who had stars at the first.
"Have no fear of this mess,"
"Have no fear!" said the cat.
"Have no fear, little fish,"
"He has gone away. Yes.
"I always pick up all my playthings
"I call this game FUN-IN-A-BOX,"
"I do NOT like the way that they play
"I do NOT wish to fall!"
"I know it is wet
"I know just what to do!" The Grinch laughed in his throat.
"I know some good games we could play,"
"I know some new tricks,"
"I MUST find some way to stop Christmas from coming!"
"I MUST stop this Christmas from coming! But HOW?"
"I will NOT go away.
"I will not let you fall.
"I will pick up the hook.
"I'll fix it up there. Then I'll bring it back here."
"If I can't find a reindeer, I'll make one instead!"
"If which kind is what, or the other way round?"
"In this box are two things
"It came with out ribbons! It came without tags!"
"It came without packages, boxes or bags!"
"Just pay me your money and hop right aboard!"
"Look at me!
"Maybe Christmas," he thought, "doesn't come from a store."
"Maybe Christmas...perhaps...means a little bit more!"
"My friends," he announced in a voice clear and keen,
"My name is Sylvester McMonkey McBean.
"My tricks are not bad,"
"No! Not in the house!"
"No, I do not like it,
"Now look at this house!
"Now look at this trick,"
"Now look what you did!"
"Now you do as I say.
"Now! Now! Have no fear.
"Now, here is a game that they like,"
"Oh dear!" said the cat,
"PoohPooh to the Whos!" he was grinchishly humming.
"Put me down!" said the fish.
"So
"So I'm taking it home to my workshop, my dear."
"So, DO something! Fast!" said the fish.
"Take a look!"
"That is good," said the fish.
"That's a noise," grinned the Grinch, "That I simply MUST hear!"
"Their mouths will hang open a minute or two,
"There's a light on this tree that won't light on one side."
"These stockings," he grinned, "are the first things to go!"
"These Things are good Things."
"They are tame. Oh, so tame!
"They like to fly kites,"
"They never will learn.
"They should not be here
"They should not fly kites
"They're finding out now that no Christmas is coming!"
"They're just waking up! I know just what they'll do!"
"This is no fun at all!
"This is stop number one," the old Grinchy Claus hissed,
"Tomorrow is Christmas! It's practically here!"
"We know who is who! Now there isn't a doubt.
"We'll have nothing to do with the Plain-Belly sort!"
"We're exactly like you! You can't tell us apart.
"We're still the best Sneetches and they are the worst.
"What you need is a trip through my Star-Off Machine.
"Why are you taking our Christmas tree? WHY?"
"Why do you sit there like that?"
"Why, for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!"
"Why, my sweet little tot," the fake Santy Claus lied,
"Why, we can have

All that cold, cold, wet day.

All the rest of that day, on those wild screaming beaches,
All the things that were down.
All the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care.
All the Whos, still asnooze When he packed up his sled,
All their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air.
Alone will be something
And a cup on my hat!
And a litte toy ship!
And a little toy man!
And all it will cost you is ten dollars eaches."
And all kinds of bad tricks.

And he brought back the toys! And the food for the feast!
And he chuckled, and clucked, "What a great Grinchy trick!"
And he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist.
And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.
And he gave them a pat.
And he got her a drink and he sent her to bed.
And he laughed as he drove
And he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat.
And he put them away.
And he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was sore.
And he said to us,
And he said, "Things are not quite as bad as you think.
And he said, "You want stars like a Star-Belly Sneetch... ?
And he stuffed them in bags. Then the Grinch, very nimbly,
And he tied a big horn on the top of his head.
And he went.
And he, HE HIMSELF! The Grinch carved the roast beast!
And here's a new trick, Mr. Knox....
And his fib fooled the child. Then he patted her head,
And I get fish right on my dish.
And I had them! At last!
And I know you'll hike far
And I said,
And I said, "How I wish
And I said, "With my net
And I will eat them here and there.
And I will eat them in a house.
And I will eat them in the rain.

And it bopped them about. But the thing really worked!
And it klonked.  And it bonked.  And it jerked.  And it berked.
And look!
And look! With my tail
And my prices are low.  And I work at great speed.
And my work is one hundred percent guaranteed!"
And never mix up your right foot with your left.
And no kind of Sneetch is the best on the beaches.
And now my story is all told.
And now we can go to your frankfurter parties."

And she said to us two,
And so deep and so tall,
And so," said the Cat in the Hat,
And so...
And some are fat.
And some are glad.
And some are low.
And some are slow.
And some are very, very bad.
And some have four.
And some have more.
And some milk on a dish!
And that handy machine
and that is why we have a Zans.
And that's how they treated them year after year.
and the beetle battle puddle is a puddle in a bottle...
And the books, and the dish,
and the bottle's on a poodle and the poodle's eating noodles...
And the cat went away
And the chances are, then,
And the fan, and the cup,
And the fish on a rake!
And the Grinch grabbed the tree, and he started to shove,
And the Grinch, with his grinch-feet ice-cold in the snow,
And the magical things you can do with that ball
And the milk and the cake!
And the milk, and the strings,
And the minute his heart didn't feel quite so tight,
And the more the Grinch thought of this Who ChristmasSing,
And the one speck of food That he left in the house,
And the Plain Belly children had none upon thars.
And the rake, and the gown,
And the ship, and the fish.
And the sun is not sunny.
And then
And then he ran out.
And then he was gone
And THEN They'd do something He liked least of all!
And then things start to happen,
And THEN!
And then! Oh, the noise! Oh, the Noise!
And they opened their beaks and they let out a shout,
And they ran to us fast.
And they'd feast! And they'd feast! And they'd FEAST!
And this mess is so big
And too cold to play ball.
And we are not too bad, you know.
And we did not like it.
And we saw him!
And what happened then? Well...in Whoville they say,
And when CindyLou Who went to bed with her cup,
And when I pull them in, Oh, Dear!
And when they battle in a puddle, 
AND when tweetle beetles battle with paddles in a puddle, 
And when you're alone, there's a very good chance
And when you're in a Slump,
And whenever they met some, when they were out walking,
And will you succeed?
And with hops and big thumps
And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go.
And you bent our new rake.
And you may not find any
And you may.
And you take them away!"
And your gang will fly on.

On his hook he had a book.
On my hand I have a dish.
On the head of her bed!
On the string of one kite
On the top of my hat!
On their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire.
On this wet, wet, wet day."
On you will go
once more you'll ride high!
One fish
One fish, Two fish, Red fish, Blue fish,
One, two, three, four,
One, two, three...
One, two, threeâ€¦
Onward up many
or a bus to come, or a plane to go
or a pot to boil, or a Better Break
or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants
or a wig with curls, or Another Chance.
Or go around back and sneak in from behind?
Or picnics or parties or marshmallow toasts,
or right-and-three-quarters? Or, maybe, not quite?
or the mail to come, or the rain to go
or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow
or the waiting around for a Yes or No
or waiting around for Friday night
or waiting for the wind to fly a kite
or waiting for their hair to grow.
or waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle Jake
Or which one was what one... of what one was who.
Our Mike sits up in back, you see.

That is what the cat said...
That one is my other brother.
That Sam-I-am

That Sam-I-am!
That the Grinch's small heart Grew three sizes that day!
That the Sneetches got really quite smart on that day,
that you'll be in a Slump.
that you'll start in to race
That's enough, sir.
That's not easy, Mr. Fox, sir.
That's not for you!
That's one thing he hated! The NOISE!
That's what made these three free fleas sneeze.
That's what that Goo-Goose is doing.
The best kind of Sneetches are Sneetches without!"
The Cat in the Hat
The Cat in the Hat!
The day they decided that Sneetches are Sneetches
The fat one has
The fat one has a yellow hat.
The Fix-it-Up Chappie kept fixing up Sneetches.
The Fix-it-Up Chappie packed up
THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFUL, AWFUL IDEA!
The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter,
The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!
The ink he likes to drink is pink.
the moon was out and we saw some sheep.
The more the Grinch thought, "I must stop this whole thing!"
THE PLACES YOU'LL GO!
The Plain-Belly Sneetches
The sun did not shine.
The tags! And the tinsel! The trimmings! The trappings!
the thing he likes to drink is ink.
The things that went on there that day?
The Waiting Place...
Their hair grows fast. So fast they say,
Then He did the same thing To the other Whos' houses
Then he fell on his head!
Then he got an idea! An awful idea!
Then he got up on top
Then he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming,
THEN He loaded some bags And some old empty sacks,
Then he said, "That is that."
Then he shook! What he saw was a shocking surprise!
Then he shut up the Things
Then he slid down the chimney. A rather tight pinch.
Then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant,
Then he slunk to the icebox. He took the Whos' feast!
Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue.
Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee.
Then he went up the chimney, himself, the old liar.
Then I let down my net.
Then I said to the cat,
Then I say, "I wish for fish!"
Then I'll make a quick trick block stack.
Then ONE day, it seems... while the Plain-Belly Sneetches
Then our fish said, "Look! Look!"
Then our mother came in
Then Sally and I
Then the Grinch said, "Giddap!" And the sleigh started down,
Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before!
Then the last thing he took Was the log for their fire!
Then the Whos down in Whoville will all cry BooHoo!"
Then the Whos, young and old, would sit down to a feast.
Then they yelled at the ones who had stars at the start,
Then those Things ran about
Then up came McBean with a very sly wink
Then we saw him pick up
Then we saw him step in on the mat!
Then we saw one kite bump
Then, of course from THEN on, as you probably guess,
Then, of course, old Sylvester McMonkey McBean
Then, of course, those with stars got frightfully mad.
Then, out of the box
Then, quickly Sylvester McMonkey McBean
Then, when every last cent
Then, with snoots in the air, they paraded about
There are points to be scored. There are games to be won.
There are some, down the road between hither and yon,
There is no way at all!"
There must be something there, I fear.
These things are fun, and fun is good.
These Things will not bite you.
These yellow pets are called the Zeds.
They actually did.  They had stars upon thars!
They are so good so good you see!
They are so good, so good, you see!
they call it a tweetle beetle puddle paddle battle.
They have come here to play.
They have one hair upon their heads.
They kept paying money.  They kept running through
They kept them away.  Never let them come near.
They left them out cold, in the dark of the beaches.
They need a haircut every day.
They never invited the Plain-Belly Sneetches.
They ran up! They ran down!
They run for fun
They run for fun in the hot, hot sun.
They said, "How do you do?
They walked all night from near to far.
They want to have fun."
They will give you some fun
They would feast on Who-pudding, and rare Who-roast beast.
They'd hike right on past them without even talking.
They'd sing! And they'd sing! And they'd SING!
They'd stand hand-in-hand. And the Whos would start singing!
Thing One and Thing Two!"
Thing One and Thing Two.
THING THING What is that thing?THING SING That thing can sing!
Thing Two and Thing One!
Things really got into a horrible mess.
Think of something to do!
This game makes my tongue quite lame, sir.
This is no good. This is not right.
This is not a good game,"
This is not good, and I know why.
This is something new.
THIS is what they call...
This one has a little car.
This one has a little star.
This one has a littlecar.
This one is quiet as a mouse.
this one, I think, is called a Yink.
This wondrous contraption will take off your stars
Thoe two Things had to stop.
Those stars weren't so big.  They were really so small
Those Things should not be
though the Hakken-Kraks howl.
though the weather be foul.
though your arms may get sore
though your enemies prowl.
Three thousand feet up! Up the side of Mt. Crumpit,
THREE TREE Three fish in a tree.
Through the machines they raced round and about again,
Through three cheese trees three free fleas flew.
To be wearing a star now was frightfully bad.
To find us this way!"
to people as brainy
To the fish in the pot.
Today is gone. Today was fun.
Today is your day.
Tomorrow is another one.
Too wet to go out
tophopstop
Toward the homes where the Whos Lay asnooze in their town.
Trick feet, Sick feet.
Try them and you may I say.
Try them and you may, I say.
Try them! Try them!
Try them! Try them! And you may.
Try to say this Mr. Knox, sir....
Try to say this, Mr. Knox, please....
Twenty-four feet
Two fish
Two socks.
Two things. And I call them
Un-slumping yourself
Until neither the Plain nor the Star-Bellies knew
Up feet, Down feet.
Up in the air feet,
UP PUP Pup is up.
UP-UP-UP with a fish!"
Very well, sir.
Very well, then, Mr. Knox, sir.
Very, very sad.
Waiting for a train to go
Waiting for the fish to bite
WALK TALK We like to talk.
WALK WALK We like to walk.
Was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse.
Was busy now, hanging a mistletoe wreath.
Was singing! Without any presents at all!
We ca not pick it up.
We did nothing at all.
We had something to do!"
We have a Wump with just one hump.
We have to open many cans.
We like our bike. It is made for three.
We like our Mike, and this is why:
We like to hop on top of Pop.
We looked!
We play a game called ring the Gack.
We sat there, we two.
We saw ALL the things fall!
We saw him sit and try to cook
We saw Mother's new gown!
We saw some sheep take a walk in their sleep.
We saw those two Things
we see them come, we see them go.
We see them come.
We see them go.
We shook their two hands.
We took a look. We saw a Nook.
We will take him home, we will call him Clark.
We'll find another game to play.
We'll find something new to do now.
We're all just the same, now, you snooty old smarties!
Well then... bring your mouth this way.
Well, we can do it. We know how.
Well...
WENT TENT SENT He went into the tent.
Were moping and doping alone on the beaches,
Wet foot, Dry foot.
WET GET Two dogs get wet.
What a lot
What a lot of funny things go by.
What a shame!
What a shame!"
What do you know about tweetle beetles?  Well...
What good to a Nook is a hook cook book?
What is new? Please tell me Ned.
What to say.
What will she say?
What would YOU do
Whatever the reason, His heart or his shoes,
whatever they are.
When a fox is in the bottle where the tweetle beetles battle 
When beetles battle beetles in a puddle paddle battle 
When beetles fight these battles in a bottle with their paddles 
When he came to the first little house on the square.
When he comes in I put him out.
When he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove.
When I wish to make a wish
When our mother is not.
When the Plain-Belly Sneetches popped out, they had stars!
When the Star-Belly children went out to play ball,
When the Star-Belly Sneetches had frankfurter roasts
When tweetle beetles fight, 
When your mother is not!
When your mother is out!"
where Boom Bands are playing.
Where do they come from? I can't say.
Where do they come from? I canâ€™t say.
WHERE IS BROWN? THERE IS BROWN!
Where the little Who stockings all hung in a row.
Wherever you fly, you'll be best of the best.
Wherever you go, you will top all the rest.
Whether this one was that one... or that one was this one
Whether you like it or not,
Which was something the Grinch couldn't stand in the least!
While these fleas flew, freezy breeze blew.
Who am I? My name is Ish
Who am I? My name is Ned
Who comes? ...
Who is this pet? Say! He is wet.
Who like to run.
Who sees who sew whose new socks, sir?
Who sews crow's clothes?
Who sews whose socks?
who soar to high heights.
Who was back in the house?
Who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold water.
Whose socks?
Why are they
Why are they sad and glad and bad?
Why do I like to hop, hop, hop?
Why, that Grinch even took their last can of Who-hash!
Why, the cat!
WILL HILL STILL Will is up hill still.

With big bumps, jumps and kicks

with the whole wide world watching you win on TV.
with their paddles in a puddle on a noodle-eating poodle, 
With their snoots in the air, they would sniff and they'd snort
With Thing One and Thing Two.
With Thing One and Thing Two?"
With your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet,
Working very precisely
Would brag, "We're the best kind of Sneetch on the Beaches."
Would stand close together, with Christmas bells ringing.
Would wake bright and early. They'd rush for their toys!
Would you eat them
Would you like them
Would you like them 
Would you like them in a house?
Would you like them with a mouse?
Would you like to play this game?
Would you like to shake hands
Would you, could you,

Would you? Could you?
Would you? Could you? In a car?
Yes! You will, indeed!
Yes. Some are red, and some are blue.
Yes. Some are red. And some are blue.

You have feet in your shoes.
You may like them
You may like them in a tree!
You may like them.
You may like them. You will see. 
you may swish for fish with my Ish wish dish.
You might think such a thing wouldn't matter at all.
You never yet met a pet, I bet,
You only could play if your bellies had stars.
You pack up those Things
You sank our toy ship,
You see Sue sew Sue's new socks, sir.
You shook up our house

You will come to a place where the streets are not marked.
You will have to get rid of
