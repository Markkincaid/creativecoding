This is a python script that I created that generates several poems based on choice, and can even be used with an outside file. The goal I had in mind was to create simple child like rhyming poems where every last word rhymes.I chose this style because I think it is indesputible that it is a poem,and was also a challenge to use new libraries in python I have never explored. Some options work better then others. The best files to use are very large ones, and already contains some rhymes(like songs, poems etc.) Make sure if you use the outside file option your file is placed in the same folder as your python files. Attached is the .py file of the program and all the files needed for the default options. Here is an example of the Dr suess poem option of my program, which in my opinion is the best option.

"My tricks are not bad,"

And some are glad.

And some are very, very bad.

Go ask your dad.

I do not know, go ask your dad.

Sad and glad and bad?

SAD DAD BAD HAD Dad is sad.

Some are sad, and some are glad,

Some are sad.

Then, of course, those with stars got frightfully mad.

To be wearing a star now was frightfully bad.

Very, very sad.

Why are they sad and glad and bad?


Revision: Added a new novel option Included a combo of the shrek and bee movie script for this option.

This was my proudest project of the semester, and was definitely the most fun for me to work on. I chose to revise this project and put it in this gallery, because I wouldnt feel like I was doing myself justice if I didnt include this project in my final gallery. As for the process, I was kind of dry on ideas for this project since I exhausted them while making it, so I took my Professors Advice and just made it so that every other chapter is now generated from a combination of the shrek movie script and the bee movie script.
