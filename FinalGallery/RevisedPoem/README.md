Revision: Added a new novel option Included a combo of the shrek and bee movie script for this option.

This was my proudest project of the semester, and was definitely the most fun for me to work on. I chose to revise this project and put it in this gallery, because I wouldnt feel like I was doing myself justice if I didnt include this project in my final gallery. As for the process, I was kind of dry on ideas for this project since I exhausted them while making it, so I took my Professors Advice and just added a novel option so It takes from larger files and gives more unique results.
