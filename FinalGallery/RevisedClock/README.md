For the following project we were asked what is time? The first thing that I thought was, what is time in the literal sense? We get time based on the earth revolving around the sun, and the earth rotating on it's axis, so when I was asked to represent time I knew I wanted to do something with space. The following files are for a p5js project that is a representation of the earth and the moon, with a digital clock in the middle. My main source of insparation was from: https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/009-solarsystemgenerator3d-texture. For coding troubles I realied on the p5js references page: https://p5js.org/reference/. The running version of the code: https://editor.p5js.org/Markkincaid/full/G46mN3Cna


Revision:

In my opinion this was my most creative project. I feel like I had a unique take on it, and took a fun yet difficult twist to it. As for the revision process, I got my idea from one of my classmates when I first showed it off, they said it looked like a doomsday clock. So I took this as an opportunity to gear it towards that. I made the clock change in size every other second, and added doomsday alarm sound to add to the effect. I think this revision was my best and wish I had thought of the idea whilst making it.
