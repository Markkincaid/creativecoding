This is a screen saver I created for my creative coding class. It was created in october of 2019 so I decided to go with a holloween theme. 
Most of how to do alot of the p5js tricks I used can be found in creative coding videos. 
And anything learned or taken elsewhere is commented in the sketch.js file itself.
All the pngs in the repository are the pictures I used in the program.
