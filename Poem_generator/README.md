This is a python script that I created that generates several poems based on choice, and can even be used with an outside file. The goal I had in mind was to create simple child like rhyming poems where every last word rhymes.I chose this style because I think it is indesputible that it is a poem,and was also a challenge to use new libraries in python I have never explored. Some options work better then others. The best files to use are very large ones, and already contains some rhymes(like songs, poems etc.) Make sure if you use the outside file option your file is placed in the same folder as your python files.
Attached is the .py file of the program and all the files needed for the default options.
