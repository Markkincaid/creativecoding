After all the hype it's hard to tell
All my dreams
All you get is pain
Allow if you're still alive six to eight years to arrive
And all that glitters is gold
And if you follow there may be a tomorrow
And just like fashion it's a passion for the with it and hip
And not a trace
And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars
And their kids were hippie chicks all hypocrites
And then I saw her face
And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire
And we could all use a little change
Another victim of ordinary fame
Because fashion is smashin' the true meaning of it
But if the offer's shunned you might as well be walkin' on the sun
But no one knows it's only me
But not for me
But the meteor men beg to differ
But the more I gave the less I got, oh yeah
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Disappointment haunted
Every morning I wake up just the same
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Fought back 'gainst the melt down
Go for the moon
Hey I know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe
Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
Hey, now, you're an all star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
I could use a little fuel myself
I couldn't leave her
I don't see myself as invincible
I got rain
I keep my game face on so well
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep, what a concept
I thought love was
I thought love was more or less a given thing
I try to hide my true identity
I'm a believer
I'm in love
I'm just like everybody else
I'm just your average ordinary everyday superhero
I'm trying to save the world
If I tried
If you got the goods they'll come and buy it just to stay in the clique
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
It ain't no joke when a mama's handkerchief is soaked
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
It's just like any fad it retracts before impact
It's kinda hard when everyone looks up to you
It's not true at all
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
Just a day job that's someone's gotta do
Just singin' and clappin' man what the hell happened
Like anybody would
Love was out to get me
Meant for someone else
Mr. Wizard can't perform no godlike hocus-pocus
My world's on fire. How about yours?
News at 10:00 your neighborhood is under attack
Not a trace
Nothing more than that, that's all I really am
Now I'm a believer
Of doubt in my mind
Of recession and oppression and together they toked
Only shooting stars
Only shooting stars break the mold
Only true in fairy tales
Put away the crack before the crack puts you away
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
So don't delay act now supplies are running out
So don't sit back kick back and watch the world get bushwhacked
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
Some they fell down and some got back up and
Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
t ain't no joke I'd like to buy the world a toke
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
That's the way it seems
The bond is broke up so choke up and focus on the close up
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
Then I saw her face
Then some were spellbound some were hellbound
This is a love attack I know it went out but it's back.
Try to make it look easy, gonna make it look good
Trying to save the world
Trying to save the world, but never really sure
Twenty-five years ago they spoke out and they broke out
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
What's the use in trying?
When I wanted sunshine
With her tears because her baby's life has been revoked
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You might as well be walkin' on the sun
You need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
