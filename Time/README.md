For the following project we were asked what is time? The first thing that I thought was, what is time in the literal sense?
We get time based on the earth revolving around the sun, and the earth rotating on it's axis, so when I was asked to represent time
I knew I wanted to do something with space. The following files are for a p5js project that is a representation of the earth and the
moon, with a digital clock in the middle. My main source of insparation was from:
https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/009-solarsystemgenerator3d-texture. 
For coding troubles I realied on the p5js references page: https://p5js.org/reference/.
