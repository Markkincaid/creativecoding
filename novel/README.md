This is my code for my creative coding class assignment. For this assignment we were required to make a novel that generates
50,000 words. Currently my novel generates around 100,000 words but is capable of much more. The code uses some AI like mechanics thanks to the library Markovify. Markovify reads a file (in my case the shrek movie script), and based on the sentance tendancies generates new sentances. As a glamorous touch around every 500 words I generated a piece of ascii art for the chapters. 
I had a lot of fun making this, and actually already had quite a few people interested in it so I tried to keep this project more clean and actually like a novel, so it is nothing crazy.

The following files are included:

Shrek.py: the python code that generates the novel.

Shrek.txt: the shrek movie script the code uses.

Shreknovel.txt: a sample novel that has already been generated.
