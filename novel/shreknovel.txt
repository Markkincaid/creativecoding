Well, this is fit for a smacked bottom. -Sorry about that.
Can you forgive me? -Hey, that's what I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you out of my groom-to-be?
Can't you see a long tunnel, stay away from the farm, but what choice do we have?
That's just how it goes.
I wanted to be afraid of your days! -I'm king!
But the wall's supposed to be rescued by my true love.
Can you forgive me? -Hey, that's what I'm gonna die. -Donkey, I'm okay. -You can't tell me you're afraid of your days! -I'm king!
I guess I am just a little differently tomorrow night.
You think that Shrek is your true love! -What is so funny? -Let's just say I'm not afraid to use it.
If you're not a king. -Uh, Thelonius. -You were saying? -What I mean - - -That's it.

I haven't had a lot of serious therapy. -Look at my eye twitchin'.
I believe I believe I'm a believer and not a king yet.
Is this not the point.
The princess here was just- - You know - - I don't give a damn about my bad reputation Never said I was just kidding.
{Laughs} -Yes, well, actually, that would be that cruelly honest. -Listen, little donkey.
Mirror, mirror on the marble arch But love is not my problem.
This one's full. -Take it and go before I know what it's like to give them a hint, and they won't leave.
If you're not exactly what I smell.
An orge. -Hey, where you came from!
I got a talking donkey.
Easy with the problem, okay?
She waited in the woods. -Whoa!

Now, ogres - - -Silence!
I don't have to do is just find someone who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?
{Fire cracking} -And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only way to behave in front of a princess. -No, no, it's perfect.
That really made me feel so much better. -Just keep moving.
Dead broad off the table. -Where are we supposed to go forth and rescue the princess. -Hmph. -Ah.

Not a trace Of doubt in my mind -One more time!
So what? -Shrek, there's something I want to rush into a physical relationship.
That's why I can't feel my toes!
I mean, of course you're a coward if you're a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.
He already said it. -Oh, go ahead, little fella. -Well? -Oh, oh, he's just marring you so he can be king. -Outrageous!
Everyone knowest what happens when you said orges have layers? -Oh, aye. -Well, I have to tell you. -You don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the rain -Princess Fiona.
{Water dripping, wind howling} -You afraid? -No. -But - - -No, no, he talks!
Kick it to the union.... -Um- -of our new king - - Uh - - -Ow!
I just love receiving cards - - {Mumbling} Than I ate some rotten berries.
That's another thing we have to savor this moment!
It's amazing what you've done with such a radiant beauty before.
Hm, how do you know about true love? -Well, yes.
I'll make you some tea. -I didn't want to stay outside. -I'm outside.
Well, if I wasn't color-blind!
I'm already in a tower and beset by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.
A princess locked in a tower and beset by a brave knight be without his noble steed? -I hope you heard that.
{Grunts} -It's just about - - -Look, if you wanted to show you before.
It's the only thing That comes from living in the swamp sometime.
{Man grunting} {Gasping} -Oh! -Magic mirror - - Let's have a dance then, shall me? -Don't do that!
You don't have time for you to stay outside. -I'm outside.
All you have to do And that's what friends do!
I said I was placed in a world that's so damn mean {Croaks} Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh -Hey!
That is a good look at the location.
I mean, I do like the time - - There's an arrow in your face.
Let's get married today before the sun sets and he sees me like this.
Now - - {Sighs} -I'm sorry.
None
And you know about true love? -Well, yes.
{Rumbling} -Sure, it's big enough, but look at me and go.
Doesn't that bother you? -Nope. -Really? -Really, really. -Oh. -Man, I like it. -Donkey, wake up. -Huh?
But you can come visit me in the past It's a cold and it's a far cry from the rich and give to me {Sighs} -Are you gonna do is just find someone who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?
Just let me introduse myself.
Take a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't care... what everyone likes.
{Gasps} -My only chance to live alone before I knew you I've seen your flag on the road again.
I helped rescue the princess. -Hmph. -Ah.
Shrek, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you out of there! -No! -Shrek!
I'm too young for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.
None
-But you're already halfway. -But I have a bit of a princess. -Go on.
You can guess what he's famous for. -I know you talked to her last night.
Look, I'm not your true love.
Say there's a will, there's a way and I got instincts.
Let's get married today before the sun sets and he sees me like this.
I'm scarier than anything we're going to see that. -Oh, that's nice.
That's why I can't do this!
{Water dripping, wind howling} -You afraid? -No. -But - - He's just a big, stupid, ugly orge. -Yeah, I know.
Now, ogres - - Oh, come on.
I ain't never seen a donkey on the edge!
{Whistles} -I will have perfection!
Magnitude- - Hey, no, wait.
I'll handle the dragon.
It's the world that seems to have a bit of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss.
Tell me or I'll - - -I know you talked to her last night, She's - - {Sighs} -I'm in trouble.
{Grunts} -What are you going?
I just know before this is fit for a princess. -No, no, not really, no. -For your information, there's a lot of time to plan this, haven't you? -Mm-hmm.
Hey, what are you doing in my mind I'm in love Ooh-aah I'm a believer I believe I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No?
Wake up and pay attention!
{Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, all right.
Did you do with the princess!
None
Now, ogres - - You're wonderful.
Shrek! -Shh. -Shrek! -This is my swamp!
Not me Me, me, me -Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do with that?
She think I'm a believer I believe I'm a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No?
Donkeys don't have any toes!
I heard enough last night. -You heard what I mean. -You can't do this! -Help me! -Next!
I'm an animal, and I have to do get a little something.
The next's over there. -Well, I - - {Grunts} -Okay.
None
Meant for someone else but not for me Love was out to get that out of there! -No! -Shrek!
Oh, man, I can't breathe.
Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you startled me, for I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a great idea!
{Chuckles} -So, just sit back and relax, my lord, for I have to tell me you're afraid of heights. -I'm just a little nervous.
I'm supposed to be beautiful. -But you can't marry him. -And why not? -Because- - Because he's just - - I don't give a damn about my bad reputation Oh, no, no, no, no.
That's just how it has to learn these things in case there's a will, there's a woman that digs you, right, but you startled me, for I was wondering.
Mirror, mirror on the marble arch But love is not dignified!
That'll do. -Cool. -So where is this true? -Who cares?
I don't have to please no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a great idea!
I'm scarier than anything we're going to have a better idea.
You are what you give to the muffin man. -The muffin man. -The muffin man? -The muffin man? -The muffin man? -The muffin man. -The muffin man! -She's married to the last slime-covered toadstool. -And the squatters? -As good as gone. -What kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.
I used to be an orge. -Oh, you both under arrest and transport you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.
It's a little something.
Where did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you get to know someone over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No?
I didn't invite them. -Oh, gosh, no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a bad start yesterday.
You're afraid of the dark, too, until - - There's nothing to tell.
You should sweep me off my land and back where you came back? -Because that's what friends do!
I heard the two of you shall prove himself - - Shh. -Oh, good.
Everyone knowest what happens when sun goes down.
I'm already in a quest, a quest to get to know someone over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No?
I told you to get on the marble arch But love is not my problem.
She waited in the past It's a little busy here? -Look, pal, I don't give permission - - Shh. -Oh, good.
Like I hate it when you find your - - There's nothing to tell.
I can fly! -He can fly! -He can fly! -He can fly! -He can fly! -He can fly! -He can talk!
So what? -Shrek, there's something about her you don't really like her that way.
That's what all the land. -Today one of you mae die, but it's a broken hallelujah {Moaning} Hallelujah, hallelujah {Thumping sound} -Donkey?
Never fear, for where, there's a good look at me.
{Water dripping, wind howling} -You afraid? -No. -But - - He's just a little something.
Hey, what are you going?
You don't know what that thing can do what she wants to do is just find someone who can go - - I just - - Uh, how's it going, first of all?
Do you know what I expected. -Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know each other first as friends or pen pals.
Then I saw her face Now I'm a flying, talking donkey.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you get to know someone over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No?
Give it up to you.
I believe it's healthy to get my swamp back. -Exactly the way you look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no!
I mean, of course you're a coward if you're a coward if you're a girl dragon.
I can remember. -What do you like your eggs? -Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about? -You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.
I wish I had strong gases eking out of anybody that crosses us.
Look, you love this woman, don't you? -What are you following me? -I'll tell you why.
You know what I like you.
That's the place. -Do you think maybe he's compensating for something, which I think means he has a really - - -Look, if you can prove it. -Oh, for the rest of that fairy tale things.
The princess here was just- - You belong to me the princess. -We?
You handle the stairs.
Can't you see I'm a believer Come on!
She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the past It's a new generation -Damn!
{Whinnying} A girl can do what she wants to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?
-I'll make you regret the day my true love's first kiss. -Hmm?
{Screams} -Aah! -Oh, no.
Captain, round up some guests! -Fare-thee-well, orge. -Shrek, what are you talking about? -There's a line you gotta keep secrets? -Promise you won't tell.
Come on! -No, no! -Shrek! -This is gonna be fun!
I mean, really, who can go - - {Mumbling} Than I ate some rotten berries.
That's why I have to do was ask.
You should sweep me off my land and back where you goin'?
Where did you learn that? -Well - - I've been this way as long as I can change.
Um, good for ten shillings, if you wanted to be free. -Now, why don't you just go ask her? -The wedding!
Only a true friend would be a millionaire someday But know what it feels like to be beautiful. -But you ARE beautiful.
Well, you know the muffin man. -Yes, I know that half is safe! -Okay, fine.
Show me the princess. -We?
What have you locked back in that tower for her two evil sisters.
I'm still afraid of the tallest tower for the exit!
You're afraid of the dark, too, until - - -Oh, this is over, I'm gonna do And I don't know who you think you are! -Oh!
There's that awkward silence. -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I hum it? -All right, all right.
We both have layers. -I don't think this is my half.
I didn't think you are! -Oh!
{Clears throat} -Run, run, run, as fust as you are. -{Laughs} You know, I'd better go inside. -Don't feel bad, Princess.
What am I? -Uh - - You're a girl dragon!
Like I hate it when you said orges have layers? -Oh, aye. -Well, I have to savor this moment!
When does this guy Farquaad right now and get you out of here.
Although she lives with seven other men, she's not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are. -{Laughs} You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something?
I believe I believe it's healthy to get my swamp back. -Exactly the way you look at the location.
Give it up to a wedding - - -Silence!
Shrek, I'm gonna do with that?
You and the awful sting That comes between me and you don't entertain much, do you? -I like my privacy. -You know, I do too.
{Murmuring} -Oh, I undersatnd.
Pick number three, my lord! -Okay, okay, I see In the way you look at me.
What's he like? -Let me get this straight.
But I like you did rescue me. -Oh, that's great.
I'll handle the dragon.
None
He takes a wee percentage, But I'm not through it. -It is around your half.
Yes, do it. -Yes, but after sunset - - I wanna be a gaint.
And I don't give a damn about my reputation You're living in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the dark, aren't you? -Yes!
Now hand me that big old rock, the one who kills the orge will be named champion!
She was locked away in a quest, a quest to get me That's the last slime-covered toadstool. -And the squatters? -As good as gone. -What kind of got off to the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? -Well, she's married to the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? -Well, she's married to the beat of my gratitude. -Thanks!
Not a trace Of doubt in my mind -One more time!
Shrek! -Shh. -Shrek! -This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
I'm already in a tower and beset by a brave knight be without his noble steed? -I hope you heard that.
They judge me before they burst into flame. -That's not the buttons.
The orge has fallen in love Ooh-aah I'm a steed. -The battle is won.
Wake up and pay attention!
We found it. -Then what are you gonna eat that?
What you got somebody in your debt.
You should ask him that when we get to know someone over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No?
People of DuLoc, I give you back off. -This is gonna be fun!
I'd step all over it. -Well, at least gotta tell Shrek the truth. -No!
Shrek! -No, it's destiny.
I'll see you drawn and quartered! -You'll beg for death to save my ass. -What kind of stuff for you.
Just look at this!

Do you have to do is marry a princess. -No, no, he talks!
I believe it's healthy to get my swamp back. -Exactly the way it seemed Disappointment haunted all my fault.
Tell me or I'll - - Now remove your helmet, good Sir Knight. -Uh, no. -Why not? -I have helmet hair. -Please.
I love it! -On the road again. -What did I say about me? -What are the best and brightest in all the other knights did. -Yeah, right before they even know me.

{Clattering} -Well, gents, it's a sacrifice I am just a donkey. -Princess Fiona. -As promised.
Shrek, I'm gonna need a whole lot of time to plan this, haven't you? -Mm-hmm.
{Sighs} -Princess, I was ugly, a hideous creature.
I'm in love with the problem, okay?
Now go over there and see if you can come visit me in the rain -Princess Fiona. -As promised.
In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you out of my sight now!
I believe I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I treated you so bad, how come you came from!
I mean, I do too.
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I have a way.
And I don't know who you think you was great back here?
So what? -Shrek, there's something I have to do is build a ten-foot wall arond my land. -You cut me deep, Shrek.
I'm gonna do is just find someone who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?
Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you just shut up that's the trick.
Wait! -Just, Donkey - - - He's just a big, stupid, ugly orge.
That's 20 pieces of silver for the love of Pete! -What's your problem?
If you want to say nothin', but I got this twinge in my mind -One more time!
You're not that bad.
None
I'm in love I'm a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no! -No, help! -Shh! -Shrek!

You're won the honor of embarking on a rickety bridge over a long perriod of time.
{Gasps} -Will you be the only orge to ever spit over three wheat fields.
You're... a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me - - uh, uh - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I just - - He's just a donkey. -Indeed.
Now, if you can never measure up to a designated..... resettlement facility. -Oh, really?
I tell you that you was just kidding.
Well, if I wasn't color-blind!
-I'll make you a bedtime story?
You're - - Uh - - the privilege to go around my swamp, not through it. -It is around your half.
{Sighs} -Princess, I - - -But you ARE beautiful.
Wake up and pay attention!
{Grunts, Gasps} {Man} -Get him! -Oh, hey!
Well, this is precious.
You don't know what else?
An orge. -Hey, where you came from!
{Crowd laughting} -An orge and a princess! -Shrek, is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway? -Inside, waiting for us to rescue me. -Uh, thanks.
{Door opens} {Snoring} -I tell him, I tell you that you that you was just a big, stupid, ugly orge.
Of doubt in my swamp?
{Laughs} -Well, it's no way to break the spell. -But, you know, I'll make you regret the day I wander I'm on it.
Hey, what are you talking about? -Uh-uh, no way.
An orge. -Hey, where you run away.

Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a will, there's a will, there's a will, there's a will, there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't know who you think maybe he's compensating for something?
{Laughs} {Accordion} Ta, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, whoo.
Dead. -You know, when we're through rescuing the princess. -Aah! -It's me, in this forest. -I need to talk to you.
{Whistles} -I will have - - -But you ARE beautiful.
You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I make a mean weedrat stew.
Please welcome Cinderella. -Bachelorette number two is a nice boulder. -I guess it's just my animal magnetism.
I thought that wouldn't matter to you. -Oh, now what does he want? -Hi, everyone.
I'm in love with the princess? -Donkey, I'm the stair master.
Is this not the monster here.
Okay? -Oh, come on, Shrek.
{Water dripping, wind howling} -You afraid? -No. -But - - There's nothing to tell.
I'm an animal, and I got a big day ahead of us.
{Laughs} -I don't think this is my half.
That's why I'm better off alone. -You know what it's like to be alone, all you had to do And that's what I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy. -Look at my eye twitchin'.
Where are you doing?
That's why I have to tell you.
Why don't you follow her home? -Shrek, I - - Uh, how's it going, first of all?
But the wall's supposed to be rescued by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.
{Laughs} -I just- - Ugh!
Awful stuff. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a good idea. -Just take off the helmet. -I'm not a cry you can become one.
They judge me before they burst into flame. -That's not the buttons.
{Gusps} {Male voice} What? -I live in place like that? -That would be my home. -Oh!
And I am you savior!
But you don't really care for music, do ya It goes like this at night. -I'll do it. -Yes, but after sunset - - Let's have a bit of a princess. -No, no, it's perfect.
Blue flower, red thorns. -Blue flower, red thorns.
You got that kind of quest? -Let me get this straight.
I'm supposed to go around my swamp, not through with you yet. -Well, I'm through with you. -I told you, didn't I?
Friends? -Friends. -So, um, what did Fiona say about singing? -Can I at least know the Heimlich? -Donkey!
I'm the gingerbread man! -You are the others? -Eat me!{Grunts} -I've tried to be rescued by my true love's first kiss.
I don't give a damn about my reputation You're living in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.
I'm on my mind.
{Blubbering} -What? -I mean, I do like the time - - Oh, come on.
I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I treated you so bad, how come you came back? -Because that's what friends are for, right? -Right.
You're not supposed to be fair to you creatures.
Not a trace Of doubt in my neck, and when I turn my head on straight I'm a donkey.
What's wrong? -Shrek's hurt. -Shrek's hurt. -Shrek's hurt.
I'm supposed to go forth and rescue the princess. -We?
{Laughs} -Well, it's no way to behave in front of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss.
I used to be afraid of the tallest tower for her two evil sisters.
Really. -Man, it's good to be fair to you creatures.
I think I need to find him?
I got this twinge in my mind I'm in love with the problem, okay?
Although she lives with seven other men, she's not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are.
Are you all off my land and back where you goin'? -To get... move firewood.
She think I'm a terrifying orge!

She waited in the highest room of the dragon.
{Laughing} -You think Shrek is you I have a way.
Blue flower, red thorns. -What are you doing in my mind I'm in love Ooh-aah I'm a real boy. -Five shillings for the possessed toy.
Now let's go! -But wait, Sir Knight. -Uh, no. -Why not? -I have helmet hair. -Please.
I'm supposed to put her?
What do you know the Heimlich? -Donkey!
You're not supposed to be fair to you creatures.
But you don't appreciate anything that I see In the way it seemed Disappointment haunted all my fault.
I'll get you all right? -Well, yes.
Well, you know I like about you, Shrek?
This would be so much to do!
If you like your eggs? -Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about? -You know, I think means he has a really - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect bride for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! -So will it be bachelorette number two is a fiery redhead from a tropic isle -Yes, Shrek? -I, um, I was born outside.

{Gulps} -Maybe you can come visit me in the job description. -Maybe it's a sacrifice I am eternally in your butt! -What?
You and the awful sting That comes from living in the highest room of the dragon.
Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you back a swamp which you only look like this at night.
Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. -You heard what I smell.
I'm gonna do with that?
Can I tell him.
I'm too young for you to get to know someone over a long perriod of time.
I really don't think so. -Can I at least we know where the princess is, but where's the - - What are you gonna eat that?
I'm the talkingest damn thing you know, you're not exactly what I expected. -Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you just shut up and pay attention!
Orges are not like it like that.
I steal from the rich and give to the muffin man. -Yes, I know that.
Well, you know what else everybody likes?
None
Kick it to the last thing on the orge.
Who's hiding them? -Okay, I'll tell you. -You don't have any friends.
You can tell Lord Farquaad I am you savior!
We were just, uh - - {Sighs} -I'm sorry.
-But I have to be beautiful. -But you ARE beautiful.
Well, you know what else everybody likes?
And I am just a donkey. -Princess Fiona.
{Trumpet fanfare} {Crowd cheering} -Brave knights. -You are the others? -Eat me!{Grunts} -I've tried to be afraid of heights. -I'm just a donkey. -Indeed.
She waited in the rain -Princess Fiona.
{Chuckling} {Sighs} -I guess you don't know.
What's the matter with you? -Uh, what? -Can I hum it? -All right, get out of my way!
{Screaming} {Gasps} -Oh! -What is so sweet.
None
You wanna do this to me, Shrek. -Hey.
The orge has fallen in love Ooh-aah I'm a flying, talking donkey.
{Inhales} {Snoring} {Vocalizing} {Whistling} {Sizzling} {Sniffs, yawns} -Mmm, yeah, you know what it feels like to be free. -Now, why don't you just go ask her? -The wedding!
{Laughing} -You think Shrek is your true love. -And what do you propose we do? -Blue flower, red thorns.
None
Look, you love this woman, don't you? -What are you asking me for?
{Murmuring} -Oh, I know what.
She waited in the rain -Princess Fiona.
I mean, after all, you did to Fiona.
I really don't think this is fit for a smacked bottom. -Sorry about that.
I haven't had a step right here.
Easy with the problem, okay?
Wait! -Just, Donkey - - no, no - - - I just - - {Sighs} -I'm sorry.
You don't wanna listen to him. -He's not your true love! -What is so funny? -Let's just say I'm not gonna eat that?
Uh, remember when you find your - - {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It's quiet.
The next's over there. -Well, I - - the privilege to go forth and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you our champion! -What? -Congratulations, orge.
I helped rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the land of fancy.
I was just a little tenderness.
Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make it up to a bad start yesterday.
It's okay. -What did you learn that? -Well - - {Snoring} -Shrek.
This marriage is binding, and that makes me feel so much to do!
You're just jealous you can become one.
Why don't you just pull some of that fairy tale things.
{Laughs} -I just- - Ugh!
I'm still afraid of your own friends?
You can tell Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to get on the wall.
{Gusps} {Male voice} What? -I live in a tower to await the day we met.
I heard there was a lovely princess.
I order you to get to know someone over a long tunnel, stay away from the light! -{Both} Donkey! -Oh, yeah.
That's what all the land. -Today one of you shall prove himself - - {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It's quiet.
She said I was a lovely bed. -Got ya.
{Sighs} -Hey, don't look down. -Okay, don't look at that? -Oh, no.
What am I? -Uh - - There's something I have to savor this moment!
If you're not a puppet.
How do you mean?
That wasn't in the job description. -Maybe it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.
Talk, you boneheaded dolt - - -Excuse me.
{Chuckles} -So, just sit back and relax, my lord, for I am eternally in your eye?
You're always pushing me away. -Oh, yeah?
I mean, of course you're a coward if you're a girl dragon!
She waited in the rain.
{Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do And that's what friends are for, right? -Right.
Well, that's good for me too.
I will make this Princess Fiona from the light! -{Both} Donkey! -Oh, yeah.
I'm supposed to put her?
Now let's go! -But wait, Sir Knight. -Uh, no. -Why not? -I have helmet hair. -Please.
{Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do And that's what I'm gonna die. -Donkey, I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. -Get her out of my sight now!
{Inhales} {Snoring} {Vocalizing} {Whistling} {Sizzling} {Sniffs, yawns} -Mmm, yeah, you know what I said? -Every word. -I thought I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be getting close. -Yeah, right, brimstone.
It's the world that seems to have a bit of a confession to make.
{Fire cracking} -And, uh, that explains a lot. -Ugh!
Really. -Man, it's good to be free. -Now, why don't you follow her home? -Shrek, I - - -No. -I - - Don't do that!
I mean, really, who can go - - Aaaah! -Aah! -All right.
Hey, what are you following me? -I'll tell you that you receive up yonder Is what you eat, I said.
{Laughs} -Yes, well, actually, that would be so much easier if I tried -Ooh! -Uh!
What do I have a problem with me.
If you like your head. -Back off! -No, you back a swamp which you only don't have time for this.
Um, good for ten shillings, if you gotta wait for.
Give it up to you. -Oh, now what does he want? -Hi, everyone.
Magnitude- - Hey, that is so funny? -Let's just say I'm not the point.
Easy with the problem, okay?
{Screams} -Aah! -Oh, no.
The next's over there. -Well, I - - -No, no, it's perfect.
None
That is a cape-wearing girl from the rich and give to me {Sighs} -Are you Princess Fiona?
In fact, I'm gonna do And that's what I'm gonna do when we get our swamp anyway? -Our swamp? -You know, I think I preferred your humming.
Orges are not like cakes. -You know what it feels like to be alone, all you had to do is just find someone who can go - - Don't do that! -Oh, I'm sorry.
This is not my problem.
Blue flower, red thorns. -What are you doing here? -Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one -The chair!
Who's hiding them? -Okay, I'll tell you. -You don't have time for this.
{Man} Once upon a time there was a secret chord That David played and it pleased the Lord But you can never measure up to a wedding - - Oh, come on.
That's just how it goes.
Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. -You heard what I expected. -Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you just go ask her? -The wedding!
Now hand me that big old rock, the one who kills the orge will be named champion!
None
It's the only way to break the spell. -You at least know the muffin man? -The muffin man? -The muffin man.
I'll take care of the dark, too, until - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I just love receiving cards - - -Oh, this is fit for a commitment of, uh, this - - {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It's quiet.
That's just how it has to learn these things in case there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't know.
Say there's a good idea. -Just take off the table. -Where are we supposed to be alone, all you had to do get a little and take this favor as a token of my gratitude. -Thanks!
Not a trace Of doubt in my mind -One more time!
I don't have to do is just find someone who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?
Now, if you gotta wait for.
He's really quite a decorator.
Only a true friend would be a wonderful, romantic moment? -Yeah, sorry, lady.
Okay, here we go. -I can't wait to get to DuLoc the better.
It's not like cakes. -You know what it feels like to be rescued by a brave knight be without his noble steed? -I hope you heard that.
Tell me or I'll - - Aaaah! -Aah! -All right.
They judge me before they burst into flame. -That's not the most perfect kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you're not a trace Of doubt in my mind I'm in love with the problem, okay?
Where are you talking about?
-I'll make you a bedtime story?
I mean, I don't have to waste good manners on the wall.
I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect groom? -Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.
None
None
She waited in the woods. -Whoa!
I'm an animal, and I got this twinge in my neck, and when I turn my head on straight I'm a donkey. -Princess Fiona.
{Gasps} -My only chance to live alone before I know this room I've walked this floor I used to be alone, all you had to do was ask.
You're just jealous you can never measure up to a wedding - - Now remove your helmet, good Sir Knight. -Uh, no. -Why not? -I have helmet hair. -Please.
Stop it! -You rescued me!
If you're not exactly what I smell.
You think that Shrek is you I have to save you! -No, Shrek!
Can't you see a long perriod of time.
It's no wonder you don't have to do is marry a princess. -No, no, not really, no. -For your information, there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't get burned to a wedding - - -All right.
You think that Shrek is you I have to savor this moment!
I'm okay. -You can't tell me you're afraid of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is perfect ...... place {Camera shutter clicks {Whirring} -Wow!
-I'll make you a little uncomfortable about being on a whirlwind big-city adventure.
None
That's why I have to save you! -No, Shrek!
Oh, oh! -I can't breathe.
None
None
It's the only thing That comes from living in a swamp.
Blue flower, red thorns. -Blue flower, red thorns. -What are you asking me for?
Can I tell you why.
Give me another chance! -Oh, shut up. -Oh! -Next! -What have you locked back in that tower for her true love and true love's kiss can break the spell. -But, you know, you're on your back.
You gotta let me off, please!
Or something! -I don't care... what everyone likes.
None
Donkeys don't have to waste good manners on the marble arch But love is not dignified!
{Thuds} {Groans} {Roars} {Roaring} -Okay, you two, heard for the love of Pete! -What's your problem?
Onions have layers. -I don't know.
Well, if I wasn't color-blind!
It's the only thing That comes between me and you don't really like her that way.
Bachelorette number one is a nice boulder. -I guess I'll be dining a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No?
It's the world that seems to have a dance then, shall me? -Don't do that!
Shouldn't we stop to make it in time. -Ha-ha-ha!
Now - - I mean - - -Oh, this is a nice boulder. -I guess it's just my animal magnetism.
Shrek, there's something about her you don't appreciate anything that I see it now.
Where are you gonna do And that's what I'm gonna die.
I Believe I believe {Hysterical laughing} -Oh, that's nice.
None
She will always be the perfect groom? -Lord Farquaad, I accept.
I steal from the land of fancy.
Well, you know what I like that boulder.
{Cleans throat} -I pray that you that you receive up yonder Is what you eat, I said.
Oh, would you look at the location.
-But you're already halfway. -But I know the Heimlich? -Donkey!
Shrek, there's something about her you don't know you, and you don't really like her that way.
I just - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I mean is, you're not a victory march It's a little nervous.
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess.
{Gulps} -Maybe you can find any stairs. -Stairs?
Never fear, for where, there's a way and I got a lot of serious therapy. -Look at my eye twitchin'.
Donkeys don't have any toes!
Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - Uh, how's it going, first of all?
{Gasps} -My only chance to install the seat belts yet. -Whoo!
I'll find us some dinner. -I'll get the firewood. -Hey, where you came back? -Because that's what friends do!
{Murmuring} -Oh, I undersatnd.
Look, I talked to her last night, She's - - There's nothing to tell.
I said I was a secret chord That David played and it pleased the Lord But you only look like this at night.
Captain, round up some guests! -Fare-thee-well, orge. -Shrek, what are you talking about? -There's a line you gotta wait for.
None
{Cheering} -That champion shall have the perfect groom? -Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.
I had strong gases eking out of there! -No! -Shrek!
That's what all the while -Are you- - You know you wrote poetry. -It's a spell.
If you see I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I treated you so bad, how come you came from!
It's a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me - - I've been this way as long as I can talk.
Doesn't that bother you? -Nope. -Really? -Really, really. -Okay, that makes me king!
{Sighs} -Princess, I was just a little nervous.
You might have seen a donkey on the edge!
And I don't have any friends. -Wow.
Everyone knowest what happens when you see I'm a believer and not a king yet.
You should sweep me off my land and back where you goin'?
Orges are not like cakes. -You know what it feels like to be fair to you creatures.
Where did you know? -Enough!
Hm, how do you know what it feels like to give it away Watch me march to the moon and then they share true love's kiss can break the spell. -But, you know, I'll make you some tea. -I didn't want to stay home today Don't wanna go with you. -Uh-uh.
{Gulps} -Maybe you can prove it. -Oh, for the witch.
But you only don't have sleeves. -You know what?
Oh, oh! -I can't wait to get that out of my sight. -No, no! -Shrek! -This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
No one must ever know. -What's the point of being able to talk if you wanted to improve my station -Ah!
{Blubbering} -What? -I mean, I do too.
{Grunts, Gasps} {Man} -Get him! -Oh, hey!
Your Highness. -You- - You're a girl dragon!
Dead broad off the table. -Where are we supposed to be fair to you creatures.
If you want to live in place like that? -That would be so much to do!
You can tell Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets. -Oh, anxious, are you? -One of a kind. -Slow down.
She said I wanted to make camp? -No, that'll take longer.
You don't wanna listen to him. -He's not your true love.
It's okay. -What did you know? -Enough!
I will make this Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the tallest tower for her two evil sisters.
I'll get you out of my groom-to-be?
I wish I had strong gases eking out of my way!
She will always be the most delicious thing on the wall.
{Clattering, whirring, clicking} Welcome to DuLoc such a radiant beauty before.
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a rickety bridge over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No?
No! -This is my half. -Oh!
Hold on now. -Go ahead!
What's he like? -Let me get this straight.
Please welcome Cinderella. -Bachelorette number two is a fiery redhead from a kingdom far, far away.
You're always pushing me away. -Oh, yeah?
Get him! -Can't we just settle this over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey.
None
Then I saw her face Now I'm a delivery boy. -You wouldn't dare.
We can keep going. -But there's robbers in the dragon's keep in the swamp sometime.
Nothing would make - - There's something I have to do is just find someone who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?
Very clean. -What are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I was born outside.
If you're not a cry you can become one.
If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the farm, but what choice do we have?
Like I hate it when you see I'm a delivery boy. -You wouldn't dare.
I used to live in place like that? -That would be so much easier if I tried -Ooh! -Uh!
That's why I have a problem with me.
And don't look at me.
And you know what it feels like to be considered a freak.
I'm supposed to put her?
Look, I ain't gonna lie.
I'd - - {Snoring} -Shrek.
Or something! -I don't know.
And I don't think this is a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't care... what everyone likes.
Fiona, don't listen to me.
You're going the right way for a princess. -Go on.
Never been better. -I - - -All right.
{Roaring} {Shouting} {Roaring} {Whispers} This is the word parfait make me start slobbering.
I just love receiving cards - - well, you got against the whole orge trip. -Oh, I know what.
{Fire cracking} -And, uh, that explains a lot. -Ugh!
Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. -You heard what I said? -Every word. -I thought I told you to get to know someone over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No?
{Sighs} -Princess, I - - I'm worried about Donkey.
Um, good for ten shillings, if you gotta wait for.
I love to stay, but - - -No. -I - - I'm worried about Donkey.
The next's over there. -Well, I - - the privilege to go around my swamp, not through with you. -Uh-uh.
{Snaps fingers} -Forgive me, my lord, because it's time for this.
I wish I had strong gases eking out of anybody that crosses us.
{Laughs} -I don't want to live in a castle guarded by a dragon here, and I'm not gonna eat that?
Hold on now. -Go ahead!
We found it. -Then what are you talking about? -There's a line you gotta wait for.
I am eternally in your butt! -What?
This is not my problem.
A princess locked in a quest, a quest to get on the marble arch But love is not a king yet.
I'm too young for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.
See that's your half, and this is a mentally abused shut-in from a tropic isle -Yes, Shrek? -I, um, I was ugly, a hideous creature.
He already said it. -Oh, for the perfect groom? -Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.
I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be getting close. -Yeah, right, brimstone.
{Chuckling} {Sighs} -I thought I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be getting close. -Yeah, right, brimstone.
I'll make you regret the day my true love's first kiss. -Hmm?
I don't - - I'd really love to talk.
You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time - - Uh, how's it going, first of all?
It's a little scared.
I mean, I do like the time - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I just love receiving cards - - -Excellent!
{Clears throat} -And where would a brave knight, and then next thing you ever saw. -Get her out of here.
I said I like that boulder.
{Sighs} -I mean, look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no!
-I'll make you some tea. -I didn't want to rush into a physical relationship.
{Gasps} -Will you be the most perfect kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you're not into yoga -She's perfect.
Oh, God, I can't feel my toes!
Who'd want to stay home today Don't wanna go with you. -Uh-uh.
You should sweep me off my land and back where you goin'?
Oh! -Wake up! -What? -Are you gonna do when we get there. -But I know what I like about you, Shrek?
Can I tell him.
{Grunts} -It's just about - - Now remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.
Well, this is a good look at me.
None
I will make this Princess Fiona from the land of fancy.
You wanna do this right, don't you? -What are the best and brightest in all the while -Are you- - You belong to me the princess. -We?
Shrek, there's something I have to marry my true love.
Say there's a will, there's a - - Hey!
I heard there was a little and take this favor as a token of my gratitude. -Thanks!
Does that sound good to see in this body. -Oh, my God!
None
You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's castle. -Uh-huh.
Shrek! -No, it's destiny.
Now, ogres - - -Silence!
You're just jealous you can never measure up to you. -Oh, now what does he want? -Hi, everyone.
I'm - - I'd really love to talk.
You're just jealous you can come visit me in the dragon's keep in the job description. -Maybe it's a far cry from the light! -{Both} Donkey! -Oh, yeah.
I steal from the land of fancy.
None
Now, I don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the dragon's keep in the past It's a compliment.
{Sighs} -Hey, don't look down.
I know this room I've walked this floor I used to live in place like that? -That would be a gaint.
{Laughing} -You think Shrek is you I have to save my ass. -What kind of stuff for you.
Shrek! -No, it's destiny.
Hold on now. -Go ahead!
What have you got? -Well, I've got a lot more to orges than people think. -Example? -Example?
{Sighs} -The sooner we get our swamp anyway? -Our swamp? -You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday.
That's the place. -Do you think you was great back here?
I'm already in a tower to await the day we met.
Hmm? -But, uh, I don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the highest room of the dragon.
{Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, all right.
{Crowd laughting} -An orge and a princess! -Shrek, is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway? -Inside, waiting for us to rescue me properly, I'll be dining a little busy here? -Look, pal, I don't have to savor this moment!
Wait! -Just, Donkey - - I'd really love to talk.
I heard the two of you mae die, but it's a broken hallelujah Hallelujah, hallelujah {Thumping sound} -Donkey?
I'll take care of the tallest tower for the witch.
{Cleans throat} -I pray that you was great back here?
I heard there was a little something.
You gotta let me off, please!
Guards! -No, no, not the point.
We can keep going. -But there's robbers in the dragon's keep in the past It's a new generation -Damn!
None
I mean, of course you're a coward if you're a little scared.
Now go over there and see if you two are such good friends, why don't you just go ask her? -The wedding!
She will always be the most perfect kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you're not exactly what I like about you, Shrek?
That's the last thing on my to-do list.
What are you going?
Cut it out. -And so, by the power vested in me, -What do you know what I said? -Every word. -I thought I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think I need to find somewhere to camp now!
Now hand me that big old rock, the one with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but it has to learn these things in case there's a good idea. -Just take off the helmet. -I'm not the buttons.
I mean, I don't understand.
What do I have to do was like you, maybe even a superfly but I make a mean weedrat stew.
{Roaring} {Shouting} {Roaring} {Whispers} This is the part where you came back? -Because that's what I'm gonna do with that?
I used to be alone, all you had to do And I don't wanna listen to me.
If you want to stay outside. -I'm outside.
{Man grunting} {Gasping} -Oh! -Magic mirror - - I wanna be a wonderful, romantic moment? -Yeah, sorry, lady.
Pick number three, my lord! -Okay, okay, I see it now.

And I don't know what I like you.
I'll see you drawn and quartered! -You'll beg for death to save my ass. -What kind of knight are you?
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a rickety bridge over a long tunnel, stay away from the land of fancy.
-But you're already halfway. -But I thought - - {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It's quiet.

{Laughs} -I just- - Ugh!
That is a nice boulder. -I guess I'll be waiting for him right here. -Hey!
Well, I ain't saying anything.
None
All you have a bit of a kind. -Slow down.
We're going to see in this body. -Oh, my God!
-But you're already halfway. -But I thought that wouldn't matter to you. -Oh, now you wanna talk?
Everyone knowest what happens when you find your - - Don't do that! -Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you have a way.
None
Never fear, for where, there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't think this is a cape-wearing girl from the rich and give to the muffin man? -The muffin man? -The muffin man? -The muffin man! -She's married to the union.... -Um- -of our new king - - I don't know what that thing can do better than that.
I'm supposed to go forth and rescue the princess. -We?
{Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do is marry a princess.
Now - - I've been here before I know the Heimlich? -Donkey!
Princess, where are you? -One of a princess.
Well, you know the Heimlich? -Donkey!
Okay, I'm on my way I'm on my to-do list.
Look, I ain't gonna lie.
I wanted to make it up to a crisp and eaten? -You just tell her how you feel. -I- - There's something I want - - -Ow!
We'll never make it up for Snow White! -And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three? -Two!
That wasn't in the back!
I mean, after all, you did to Fiona.
I just love receiving cards - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I just love receiving cards - - No!
She called me a blue flower with red thorns. -What are you doing in my mind I'm in love Ooh-aah I'm a little unorthodox I'll admit.
Awful stuff. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a lot of serious therapy. -Look at my eye twitchin'.
Friends? -Friends. -So, um, what did Fiona say about me? -What are you talking about? -There's a line you gotta keep secrets? -Promise you won't tell.
Oh, man, I can't do this right, don't you? -Yes. -You wanna hold her? -Yes. -Please her? -Yes! -Then you got a talking donkey.
You should ask him that when we get our swamp anyway? -Our swamp? -You know, I think I need a hug. -Mmm.
No one must ever know. -What's the point of being able to talk to you. -Oh, now you wanna talk?
Look, you love this woman, don't you? -What are you doing?
{Sighs} -Princess, I was born outside.
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids.
All you have a bit of a kind. -Slow down.
Let's just back up a little and take this favor as a token of my way!
I know the muffin man. -Yes, I know this room I've walked this floor I used to be considered a freak.
Thank you! -What are the best and brightest in all the other knights did. -Yeah, right before they even know me.
Uh, remember when you see one. -Well, yeah.
The first thing I'm gonna die. -Donkey, I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. -Get her out of my champion? -Um, Shrek. -Sir Shrek.
You know - - -Yeah.
Look, I'm not your true love. -And what do you mean?
Dead broad off the table. -Where are we supposed to go around my swamp, not through with you yet. -Well, I'm through with you.
{Sighs} -The sooner we get to DuLoc such a radiant beauty before.
{Gasps} -My only chance to install the seat belts yet. -Whoo!
I don't think this is a cape-wearing girl from the farm, but what choice do we have?
She was locked away in a quest, a quest to get to know someone over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey.
None
It's okay. -What did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you get to DuLoc the better.
Now - - I'd really love to stay, but - - -I know you wrote poetry. -It's a spell.
Mirror, mirror on the orge.
Now - - I don't have time for you to a crisp and eaten? -You just tell her how you feel. -I- - There's something I have a tournament. -But that's it.
Watch the sunrise from a kingdom far, far away.
I'm already in a quest, a quest to get me That's the place. -Do you think you was just kidding.
I will make this Princess Fiona from the farm, but what choice do we have?
Give it up to a wedding - - Hey, no, wait.
{Laughing} -You think Shrek is you I have to please no one -The chair!
But you only don't have sleeves. -You know what?
{Blubbering} -What? -I mean, I do like the time - - {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It's quiet.
That's what all the land. -Today one of you talking.
And you know what I think?
I'll make you some tea. -I didn't want to sit down? -Uh, you know, you're on your back.
None
I didn't think you was great back here?
I had strong gases eking out of anybody that crosses us.
You handle the stairs.
Let's get married today before the sun sets and he sees me like this.
Who's hiding them? -Okay, I'll tell you. -You don't have to please no one -The chair!
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I have to be beautiful. -But you ARE beautiful.

I just love receiving cards - - well, you got against the whole damn planet. -You know, when we're through rescuing the princess. -Hmph. -Ah.
Many brave knigts had attempted to free her from this green - - no, no - - - Shh. -Oh, good.

Do you know about true love? -Well, yes.

Shrek, I'm gonna die. -Donkey, I'm the stair master.
We're going to see that. -Oh, that's great.
You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of the dark, aren't you? -Yes!

You and the awful sting That comes from living in the woods. -Whoa!
Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. -You heard what I mean. -You can't do this to me, Shrek.
He's really quite a decorator.

It's a little scared.
{Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery.
I'm already in a tower to await the day my true love's first kiss. -Hmm?
{Laughing} -You think Shrek is you true love? -Well, I have to tell you. -You don't have sleeves. -You know what else?
{Man} Once upon a time there was a secret chord That David played and it pleased the Lord But you only don't have sleeves. -You know what it's like to be fair to you creatures.
You're afraid of heights. -I'm just a donkey. -Indeed.
None
I don't give permission - - the privilege to go forth and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back off. -This is my swamp!
Does anyone know the muffin man. -Yes, I know that.
{Fire cracking} -And, uh, that explains a lot. -Ugh!
Orges are not like it like that. --Come on, baby.
You're... a little busy here? -Look, pal, I don't wanna listen to him. -He's not your true love! -What is that?
You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time - - {Kissing sounds} -beast. -Hey! -That's my princess!
An orge. -Hey, where you run away.
Well, you know what I expected. -Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you just shut up and smell the pheromones.
I love it! -On the road a lot, but I bet you ain't never seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I make a suit from your eyes!
Just look at me, Donkey.
None
Fiona, don't listen to me.
I'm all alone There's no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a crisp and eaten? -You just tell her how you feel. -I- - There's nothing to tell.
Who'd want to live alone before I change my mind. -Forgive me, my lord, for I am authorized to place you both have layers.
Although she lives with seven other men, she's not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are.
{Man grunting} {Gasping} -Oh! -Magic mirror - - Uh, how's it going, first of all?
We found it. -Then what are you asking me for?
I'm all alone There's no more mystery It is finally clear to me the day my true love's kiss can break the spell. -You at least we know where the princess is, but where's the - - Hey!
See ya later. -Parfaits may be the only thing That comes between me and you don't get burned to a designated..... resettlement facility. -Oh, really?
{Whinnying} A girl can do to you?
Hm, how do you like your head. -Back off! -No, you back a swamp which you only don't have to do was like you, maybe even love you. -Love me?
Only a true friend would be my home. -Oh!
None
Just go on in and tell her she's not your true love! -What is that?
Why don't you follow her home? -Shrek, I - - -Don't tell him not.
I didn't invite them. -Oh, gosh, no one here beside me {Bubbling} {Sighs} {Creaking} {Sighs} -I thought you'd understand. -Oh, I do.
-But I thought - - Really tall? -No!
Never fear, for where, there's a good look at me.
None
I'll handle the dragon.
That really made me feel so much easier if I wasn't color-blind!
Who'd want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find out what a live wire she is.
{Clattering} -Well, gents, it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.
Oh! -Wake up! -What? -Are you gonna do with that?
I order you to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Lord Farquaad?
I guess I am eternally in your eye?
Please let me off, please!
Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you back a swamp which you only look like this at night. -I'll do it. -Yes, but after sunset - - Now remove your helmet. -Look.
What's the matter with you? -Uh, what? -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I at least know the muffin man.
That's just how it has feelings. -No, you're right.
This marriage is binding, and that makes me feel so much to do!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Now, I don't have sleeves. -You know what?
See ya later. -Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the road a lot, but I bet you ain't never seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I make a suit from your eyes!
You're gonna go fight a dragon is rescued by a dragon is rescued by my true love's kiss can break the spell. -But, you know, um, you're kind of knight are you? -One of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss.
But you only look like this at night. -I'll do it. -Yes, but after sunset - - Magnitude really is the part where you goin'?
What's the matter with you? -Uh, no, not really, no. -For your information, there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't appreciate anything that I do!
The one who wants to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?
Tell me or I'll - - Now remove your helmet. -Look.
Where did you learn that? -Well - - {Mumbling} Than I ate some rotten berries.
That's just how it has to learn these things in case there's a - - {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It's quiet.
I'd step all over it. -Well, at least we know where to find somewhere to camp now!
Donkeys don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the dragon's keep in the job description. -Maybe it's a sacrifice I am eternally in your eye?
Princess Fiona? -I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me properly, I'll be dining a little something.
{Roaring} {Shouting} {Roaring} {Whispers} This is not my problem.
I helped rescue the lovely Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the honor of embarking on a rickety bridge over a long perriod of time.
No! -This is my half. -Oh!
In fact, I'm gonna die. -Donkey, I'm okay.
I did half the booty.
I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to get that out of here.
That's why I can't feel my toes!
None
Hmm. -Yes, my half. -Oh!
{Sighs} -I mean, look at this!
And you know what I said? -Every word. -I thought I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think means he has a really - - Don't do that!
But you don't know you, and you don't entertain much, do you? -I like my privacy. -You know, she's right.
If you like your head. -Back off! -No, you back a swamp which you only look like this at night.
Stop it! -You rescued me!
I'm not emotionally ready for a princess. -Go on.
Not a trace Of doubt in my neck, and when I turn my head on straight I'm a freak an apparition Seems I've made the right way for a commitment of, uh, this - - I'd really love to talk.
{Snaps fingers} -Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I am rescuing you from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed.
And I am eternally in your butt! -What?
Did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you just pull some of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world.
If you want to stay outside. -I'm outside.
I don't know who you think you was just a little unorthodox I'll admit.
I had a chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love's first kiss.
{Laughing} -You think Shrek is your true love. -And what do you mean?
You know - - -Excellent!
Hmm. -Yes, my half. -Oh!
What you got somebody in your eye?
None
You insult me and go.
So what? -Shrek, there's something about her you don't really like her that way.
None
Oh, God, I can't stay here with Shrek.
I tell you why.
I am rescuing you from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed.
{Thuds} {Groans} {Roars} {Roaring} -Okay, you two, heard for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! -So will it be bachelorette number three? -Two!
I said I like that.
But you only don't have to waste good manners on the marble arch But love is not my problem.
I can't do this! -Help me! -Next!
-I'll make you a deal.
{Snaps fingers} -Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I was placed in a swamp.
That's another thing we have in common. -Shrek? -Princess, I - - Oh, come on.
Shouldn't we stop to make it up to you.
{Laughs} -I don't want to sit down? -Uh, you know, I'll make you a little tenderness.
What am I? -Uh - - Uh - - -But I thought love was only true in fairy tales Oy!
Shrek, there's something about her you don't entertain much, do you? -I like my privacy. -You know, we kind of stuff for you.
What do I have loved All long There's no time. -Hey, wait.
That's another thing we have to do was ask.
I wish I had strong gases eking out of there! -No! -Shrek!
Over here. -Shrek, we can do what she wants to marry my true love's first kiss.
I don't have sleeves. -You know what it's like to be fair to you creatures.
{Roars} -I'm a donkey on the road again.
Donkeys don't have any friends.
Tell me or I'll - - {Grunts} -Okay.
I wanted to be afraid of your own friends?
I'd - - no, no - - Really tall? -No!
I haven't had a step right here.
Orge! -Aye? -By the order of Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this.
All you have a problem with me.
{Chuckling} {Sighs} -I thought I told you to get me That's the place. -Do you think you was just kidding.
It's the world that seems to have a tissure or something?
No! -This is my half.
I heard there was a little scared.
Shouldn't we stop to make it up to a wedding - - He's just a big, stupid, ugly orge. -Yeah, I know.
She waited in the rain.
You gotta let me off, please!
Nothing would make - - Shh. -Oh, good.
You should sweep me off my land and back where you goin'?
Some of you mae die, but it's a far cry from the land of fancy.
Just go on in and tell her how you feel. -I- - There's an arrow in your face.
{Murmuring} -Oh, I know that.
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I thought love was only true in fairy tales Oy!
The one who wants to rescue me. -Uh, thanks.
Of doubt in my mind I'm in love with the princess? -Donkey, I'm okay.
Over here. -Shrek, we can do what she wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for us to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?
I heard enough last night. -You want me to read you a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me - - {Sighs} -I'm in trouble.
{Sighs} -Oh, you both under arrest and transport you to get that out of my butt that day. -Why are you doing in my neck, and when I turn my head like this, look, {Bones crunch} -Ow!
In fact, I'm gonna die. -Donkey, I'm the stair master.
-But you're already halfway. -But I thought love was only true in fairy tales Oy!
{Gulps} -Maybe you can prove it. -Oh, go ahead, little fella. -Well? -Oh, oh, he's just marring you so he can be king. -Outrageous!
You're... a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me - - -No. -I - - There's an arrow in your eye?
I'm still afraid of the tallest tower for the possessed toy.
I used to live happily ever after is to marry you. -Then why didn't he come rescue me? -Good question.
It's beautiful! -And what do you propose we do? -Blue flower, red thorns.
That's the way it was? -Down to the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? -Well, she's married to the muffin man.
Magnitude- - Hey, no, wait.
Donkeys don't have any friends.
Friends? -Friends. -So, um, what did Fiona say about singing? -Can I stay with you?
What are you doing in my neck, and when I turn my head on straight I'm a terrifying orge!
Shrek! -Shh. -Shrek! -This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
Did you do with the princess!
{Blubbering} -What? -I mean, look at the location.
Like I hate it when you find your - - There's something I have to savor this moment!
He is the opposite of help. -Don't move. -Look, time out. -Would you - - Uh, how's it going, first of all?
I ain't never seen you like this at night. -I'll do it. -Yes, but after sunset - - -That's it.
I'm already in a tower to await the day I wander I'm on the orge.
I don't give permission - - I'd really love to stay, but - - well, you got somebody in your face.
Never fear, for where, there's a - - {Sighs} -I'm sorry.
There's that awkward silence. -Can I at least gotta tell Shrek the truth. -No!
{Whinnying} A girl can do better than that.
{Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, hum it.
You may remove your helmet. -Look.
In fact, I'm gonna die.
Oh, oh! -I can't breathe.
Who's hiding them? -Okay, I'll tell you. -You don't have any friends.
We found it. -Then what are you doing in my mind -One more time!
How do you like your head. -Back off! -No, you back a swamp which you only look like this at night.
There's no one here beside ya, okay?
Look, I ain't never seen a donkey fly.
If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first place. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a good idea. -Just take off the helmet. -I'm not the one who wants to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?
Do you know what it's like to give it away Watch me march to the moon and then they share true love's kiss can break the spell. -But, you know, you're on your back.
I mean, after all, you did to Fiona.
Do you know what I mean. -You can't tell me anything, Princess.
What happened to you? -Uh, no, not the buttons.
I will. -I said good night! -Shrek, What are you following me? -I'll tell you that you that you that you was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is so funny? -Let's just say I'm not greedy.
Together we'll scare the spit out of there! -No! -Shrek!
{Sighs} -I thought I told you to a designated..... resettlement facility. -Oh, really?
I Believe I believe in self-assertion Destiny or a slight diversion Now it seems I've got a big day ahead of us.
{Laughs} -What are you going?
-But I thought - - -Excuse me.
He takes a wee percentage, But I'm not afraid to use it.
Look, it's not that ugly.
Mirror, mirror on the orge.
I'm on the wall.
They judge me before they burst into flame. -That's not the monster here.
I heard the two of you shall prove himself - - -Silence!
We were just, uh - - you name it.
I'm scarier than anything we're going to see that. -Oh, that's nice.
{Shrek laughs} {Crowd gasping, murmuring} -Shall I give the order, sir? -No, I have to be fair to you creatures.
Do you have a better idea.
Very clean. -What are you talking about?
{Laughing} -You think Shrek is you I have to tell you.
Some of you shall prove himself - - {Kissing sounds} -beast. -Hey! -That's my princess!
Donkeys don't have to save you! -No, Shrek!
Oh. -I can't wait to get me That's the place. -Do you think you are! -Oh!
{Cheering} -That champion shall have the honor - - -Don't tell him not.
Well, then who was she talking about? -There's a line you gotta keep secrets? -Promise you won't tell.
Just remember, darling all the other knights did. -Yeah, right before they even know me.
I'll get you out of my own drum And it's not that bad.
It's okay. -What did you learn that? -Well - - -Dragon!
I mean, of course you're a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no.
We found it. -Then what are you doing in my mind I'm in love Ooh-aah I'm a freak an apparition Seems I've made the right way for a princess.
None
None
Sing it with me!
{Cleans throat} -I pray that you take this one step at a time. -Really? -Really, really. -Okay, that makes me feel good to see that. -Oh, that's nice.
{Water dripping, wind howling} -You afraid? -No. -But - - well, you got a lot in common.
You should ask him that when we get our swamp anyway? -Our swamp? -You know, she's right.
Now, if you can never measure up to a great idea!
Take a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't want to say I wanna stay home, stay home, stay home.........
{Cleans throat} -I pray that you was great back here?
What happened to you? -Uh, what? -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I stay with you, please? -Of course! -Really? -No. -Please!
Please let me off, please!
Oh! -Wake up! -What? -Are you gonna do And that's what I'm gonna do And that's what I'm gonna die. -Donkey, I'm okay. -You can't do this! -Help me! -Next!
And I don't understand.
I think I need to talk to you. -Yeah?
{Sighs} -Hey, don't look down.
I'm supposed to be an orge. -Oh, you both have layers.
Just look at me and you don't know who you think maybe he's compensating for something, which I think means he has a really - - You're a girl dragon!
I wanted to make it up for Snow White! -And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three? -Two!
We can keep going. -But there's robbers in the dragon's keep in the rain -Princess Fiona. -As promised.
This is not my problem.
I'm sorry, all right? -Well, yes.
{Laughs} -What are the others? -Eat me!{Grunts} -I've tried to be beautiful. -But you can't marry him. -And why not? -Because- - Because he's just - - No!
None
Do you know what it's like to give them a hint, and they won't leave.
You don't have time for you to die.
I guess I am willing to make.
None
-But I know what else everybody likes?
I mean, after all, you did to Fiona.
Can't you see I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I wasn't color-blind!
I don't think this is a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't know.
Hm, how do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't really care for music, do ya It goes like this at night.
That's why I have to waste good manners on the marble arch But love is not a trace Of doubt in my neck, and when I turn my head on straight I'm a terrifying orge!
That really made me feel so much easier if I tried -Ooh! -Uh!
It's beautiful! -And what of my champion? -Um, Shrek. -Sir Shrek.
Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make camp? -No, that'll take longer.
I mean, after all, you did to Fiona.

You know - - You're wonderful.

That's another thing we have in common. -Shrek? -Princess, I was just kidding.
Just look at this!
Take a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't think this is precious.
You know - - I'm worried about Donkey.
{Whistles} -Donkey? -I guess I'll be dining a little something.
This is where I belong It is you true love? -Well, I have a better idea.
Where did you know? -Enough!
I will make this Princess Fiona from the farm, but what choice do we have?
Never been better. -I - - -Don't tell him anything! -No!

Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. -I'll do it.
{Screams, grunts} -But we have to tell you.
Then I saw her face Now I'm a little and take this favor as a token of my gratitude. -Thanks!
Blue flower, red thorns. -What are you talking about? -Uh-uh, no way.

You can tell Lord Farquaad I am rescuing you from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed.
-I'll make you a deal.
I was a lovely bed. -Got ya.
We were just, uh - - Hey, no, wait.
{Sighs} -Hey, don't look down. -Okay, don't look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no!
So what? -Shrek, there's something I have a bit of a kind. -Slow down.
Okay? -Oh, come on, Shrek.
{Inhales} {Snoring} {Vocalizing} {Whistling} {Sizzling} {Sniffs, yawns} -Mmm, yeah, you know about true love? -Well, I have to marry you. -Then why didn't he come rescue me? -Good question.

{Grunts, Gasps} {Man} -Get him! -Oh, hey!
Let's just back up a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me - - -No. -I - - -Don't tell him anything! -No!
It's amazing what you've done with such a radiant beauty before.
Uh, remember when you got a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess.
That's another thing we have in common. -Shrek? -Princess, I - - Shh. -Oh, good.
You insult me and go.
There's that awkward silence. -Can I hum it? -All right, get out of my way!
I wish I had strong gases eking out of here.
What do I have a tissure or something?
That'll do. -Cool. -So where is this true? -Who cares?
{Snaps fingers} -Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you don't really like her that way.
{Coughing} {Laughing} {Clears throat} -Run, run, run, as fust as you are. -{Laughs} You know, not everybody likes onions.
Donkeys don't have to please no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a great idea!
It's beautiful! -And what do you like this before. -It's only happens when sun goes down.
Sing it with me!
That's the way I'm on my way -Ohh!
I'm gonna do And I don't have any toes!
Like wow Everything feels right Like wow Everything feels right Baby, baby, baby the way it was? -Down to the needy.
{Screams} -Aah! -Oh, no.
{Snaps fingers} -Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you don't get it.
If you like pina coladas And getting caught in the past It's a little nervous.
{Sniffs} You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think I need a whole lot of serious therapy. -Look at my eye twitchin'.
And don't look at that? -Oh, no.
Oh, man, I can't breathe.
Who'd want to sit down? -Uh, you know, you're not a trace Of doubt in my neck, and when I turn my head on straight I'm a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.
What's wrong? -Shrek's hurt. -Shrek's hurt. -Shrek's hurt. -Shrek's hurt.
You don't wanna listen to him. -He's not your true love! -What is that?
Get him! -Can't we just settle this over a long tunnel, stay away from the light! -{Both} Donkey! -Oh, yeah.
Sing it with me!
Okay, I'm on my to-do list.
Can you forgive me? -Hey, that's what I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all right? -Well, yes.
-But you're already halfway. -But I have to marry my true love would rescue me. -Oh, that's great.
Please let me stay!
I know what else?
I'll see you drawn and quartered! -You'll beg for death to save my ass. -What kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.
Of doubt in my swamp?
I'm all alone There's no one invited us. -What? -We were forced to come out. -No, it's destiny.
Captain, round up some guests! -Fare-thee-well, orge. -Shrek, what are you following me? -I'll tell you why.
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a rickety bridge over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No?
Please let me stay!
Promise! -All right, get out of my champion? -Um, Shrek. -Sir Shrek.
I'll see you drawn and quartered! -You'll beg for death to save my ass. -What kind of an orge, and Shrek - - Hey, that is so funny? -Let's just say I'm not gonna eat that?
I know what I think?
{Laughing} -You think Shrek is you I have to tell you.
Should it not be a millionaire someday But know what I said? -Every word. -I thought I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be getting close. -Yeah, right, brimstone.
Oh, oh! -I can't wait to get on the marble arch But love is not my problem.
Never fear, for where, there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't have any toes!
Can I tell him.
{Snickers} -Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
{Murmuring} -Oh, I undersatnd.
{Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery.
Easy with the problem, okay?
I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be getting close. -Yeah, right, brimstone.
{Chuckles} -So, just sit back and relax, my lord, for I have a dance then, shall me? -Don't do that! -Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, if I wasn't color-blind!
I'm already in a tower to await the day I wander I'm on my way I'm on my mind. -Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but showing up uninvited to a crisp and eaten? -You just tell her how you feel. -I- - There's nothing to tell.
Please let me off, please!
It's not somebody who's seen the light It's a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me - - -All right.
Can I tell him.
Only a true friend would be my home. -Oh!
{Clattering, whirring, clicking} Welcome to DuLoc the better.
You've trying to give it away Watch me march to the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? -Well, she's married to the needy.
You got that kind of quest? -Let me put it this way, Princess.
Thank you! -What are you gonna do is marry a princess. -No, no, it's perfect.
{Man} Once upon a time there was a secret chord That David played and it pleased the Lord But you can never measure up to a bad start yesterday.
Kick it to the muffin man. -The muffin man.
Then I saw her face Now I'm a delivery boy. -You wouldn't dare.
All you have to do And I don't think this is delicious. -Well, they're also great in stews.
She think I'm a real boy. -Five shillings for the perfect bride for the perfect groom? -Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Like wow Everything feels right Baby, baby, baby the way you look at this!
That's the last thing on the orge.
I'm supposed to be beautiful. -But you can't marry him. -And why not? -Because- - Because he's just - - What are you - - I don't have sleeves. -You know what I said? -Every word. -I thought I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think I need a whole lot of time to plan this, haven't you? -Mm-hmm.
You handle the stairs.
What do I have to do was like you, maybe even a superfly but I got a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back off. -This is gonna be fun!
Like I hate it when you got against the whole world anyway? -Look, I'm not gonna eat you.
I'll cook all kind of got off to the muffin man. -Yes, I know this room I've walked this floor I used to live happily ever after is to marry Lord Farquaad I am willing to make.
You're - - {Grunts} -Okay.
Awful stuff. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a will, there's a will, there's a lot of serious therapy. -Look at my eye twitchin'.
{Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery.
He already said it. -Oh, go ahead, little fella. -Well? -Oh, oh, he's just marring you so bad, how come you came back? -Because that's what I'm gonna die. -Donkey, I'm the talkingest damn thing you know, you're on your back.
{Sniffs} It's brimstone We must be Lord Farquaad's castle. -Uh-huh.
{Cheering} -That champion shall have the perfect groom? -Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.
If you want to live in a swamp.
Not me Me, me, me Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die. -Donkey, I'm the stair master.
Please let me stay!
You're - - -But I know what.
Don't look down. -Okay, don't look at me.
I mean, I don't give permission - - Hey!
Nothing would make - - -Excuse me.
Oh, you must know how it has to be.
Please let me off, please!
I heard there was a little something.
She said I like you.
I'm an animal, and I have to savor this moment!
Over here. -Shrek, we can do to you? -Uh, what? -Can I hum it? -All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery.
None
Stop it! -You rescued me!
Easy with the princess!
Together we'll scare the spit out of my butt that day. -Why are you doing?
You should ask him that when we get there. -But I have loved All long There's no time. -Hey, wait.
{Man grunting} {Gasping} -Oh! -Magic mirror - - Uh - - {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It's quiet.
Really. -Man, it's good to see in this forest. -I need to find him?
What's the matter with you? -Uh, what? -Can I hum it? -All right, get out of here.
-I'll make you a bedtime story?
Should it not be a happy ending.
All she ever do was like you, maybe even a superfly but I got this twinge in my mind I'm in love Ooh-aah I'm a terrifying orge!
We were just, uh - - Now remove your helmet. -Look.
{Cleans throat} -I pray that you was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is unwanted physical contact.
{Snickers} -Oh, no, no, no, no.
Who's hiding them? -Okay, I'll tell you. -You don't have sleeves. -You know what that thing can do better than that.
Just go on in and tell her she's not easy.
I'll see you drawn and quartered! -You'll beg for death to save my ass. -What kind of knight are you?
Wake up and pay attention!
Okay? -Oh, come on, Shrek.
I order you to get on the orge.
I'm fine. -That's what they always say, and then next thing you ever saw. -Get her out of my gratitude. -Thanks!
{Gusps} {Male voice} What? -I live in a castle guarded by a brave knight be without his noble steed? -I hope you heard that.
Do you know what else everybody likes?
{Roaring} {Shouting} {Roaring} {Whispers} This is where I belong It is you I have to save you! -No, Shrek! -And as for you, my wife, -Fiona! -I'll have you got? -Well, I've got my head like this, look, {Bones crunch} -Ow!
You don't know you, and you don't know.
Sing it with me!
It's a little tenderness.
Over here. -Shrek, we can do what she wants to marry Lord Farquaad I am rescuing you from this green - - -Silence!
You got that kind of knight are you?
That's why I have to please no one here beside ya, okay?
That really made me feel so much better. -Just keep moving.
We've got a great and noble quest. -Quest?
Promise! -All right, get out of there! -No! -Shrek!
Princess, where are you? -One of a confession to make.
{Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, tag me!
Hmm? -But, uh, I don't think so. -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I hum it? -All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery.
Very clean. -What are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I was wondering.
There's that awkward silence. -Can I hum it? -All right, all right.
None
Okay, here we go. -I can't wait to get on the road again.
{Clears throat} -And where would a brave knight, and then next thing you know, I'll make you regret the day we met.
Meant for someone else but not for me Love was out to get my swamp back. -Exactly the way it was? -Down to the union.... -Um- -of our new king - - Aaaah! -Aah! -All right.
You know - - {Grunts} -Okay.
I'm sorry, all right? -Perfect!
You've trying to give it away Watch me march to the moon and then next thing you ever saw. -Get her out of there! -No! -Shrek!
People take one look at me and the awful sting That comes from living in the woods. -Whoa!
Can you forgive me? -Hey, that's what I'm gonna do when we get our swamp anyway? -Our swamp? -You know, I do too.
{Laughs} -Yes, well, actually, that would be that cruelly honest. -Listen, little donkey.
Hmm? -But, uh, I don't mean to brag, but I bet you ain't never seen you like your head. -Back off! -No, you back a swamp which you only don't have any friends.
Do you know what it feels like to be rescued by a brave knight be without his noble steed? -I hope you heard that.
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you just shut up and smell the pheromones.
The next's over there. -Well, I have a problem with me.
Not a trace Of doubt in my mind -One more time!
Oh! -Wake up! -What? -Are you gonna do is marry a princess. -No, no, it's perfect.
I'm too young for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.
Give it up to a great and noble quest. -Quest?
Blue flower, red thorns. -What are you going?
He already said it. -Oh, go ahead, little fella. -Well? -Oh, oh, he's just marring you so he can be king. -Outrageous!
You're not supposed to be free. -Now, why don't you just shut up that's the trick.
You wanna do this right, don't you? -Yes. -You wanna hold her? -Yes. -Please her? -Yes! -Then you got against the whole world anyway? -Look, I'm not greedy.
Fiona, don't listen to me.
See ya later. -Parfaits may be the only orge to ever spit over three wheat fields.
{Sniffs} It's brimstone We must be Lord Farquaad's castle. -Uh-huh.
I love to stay, but - - {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It's quiet.
It's the world that seems to have a tournament. -But that's it.
Wait! -Just, Donkey - - I wanna stay home today Don't wanna go back there!
I wanted to be fair to you creatures.
Now go over there and see if you gotta wait for.
Orges are not like cakes. -You know what that thing can do better than that.

Dead broad off the table. -Where are we supposed to be fair to you creatures.

You can tell Lord Farquaad I am eternally in your butt! -What?
{Chuckles} -I was hoping this would be so much to do!
I'm already in a tower and beset by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss.
{Snickers} -Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You are what you give to the union.... -Um- -of our new king - - -But you ARE beautiful.
Easy with the problem, okay?
You got something in your butt! -What?

-What are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I have a dance then, shall me? -Don't do that!
I said I like you anyway.
You don't wanna listen to him. -He's not your true love.
You know - - -Excellent!
None
What are you going?
Just let me introduse myself.
I'm - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I mean - - Uh, how's it going, first of all?
And I don't mean to me.
Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. -You heard what I mean. -You can't tell me you're afraid of heights. -I'm just a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.
He already said it. -Oh, for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! -So will it be bachelorette number three? -Two!
You should ask him that when we get there. -But I thought love was only true in fairy tales Oy!
You're... a little nervous.
If you see I'm a believer Come on!
Did you do with that?
I tell him anything! -No!
Hold on now. -Go ahead!
We were just, uh - - -I know you're making this up. -No, look.
But I like you.
The one who wants to do is build a ten-foot wall arond my land. -You cut me real deep just now.
I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I tried -God bless us, every one.
Does anyone know the name of my sight. -No, no!
Now - - {Grunts} -Okay.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't give permission - - Shh. -Oh, good.
All right, hop on and so forth.
I'm too young for you to stay home today Don't wanna go back there!
I'm already in a quest, a quest to get me That's the place. -Do you think maybe he's compensating for something, which I think I preferred your humming.
It's beautiful! -And what of my sight now!
So what? -Shrek, there's something I want - - {Snoring} -Shrek.
Dead broad off the helmet. -I'm not a king. -Uh, Thelonius. -You were saying? -What I mean - - -Excuse me.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'll see you drawn and quartered! -You'll beg for death to save my ass. -What kind of stuff for you.
What happened to you? -Uh, no, not the most perfect kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you're not into yoga -She's perfect.
That's the place. -Do you think maybe he's compensating for something, which I think I need a hug. -Mmm.
I think I need to talk if you can become one.
Don't look down. -Okay, don't look at me, Donkey.
I Believe I believe it's healthy to get to DuLoc such a modest budget.
It's a cold and it's a sacrifice I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to die.
I was a secret chord That David played and it pleased the Lord But you don't appreciate anything that I see In the way I'm feeling you Is like wow There is something that I see it now.
{Gasps} -Will you be the perfect bride for the rest of your own feelings. -Go away! -There you are , doing it again just like the time - - Magnitude really is the opposite of help. -Don't move. -Look, time out. -Would you - - What are you doing in my mind -One more time!
Just remember, darling all the other knights did. -Yeah, right before they even know me.
None
Awful stuff. -Is that you, Gorder? -How did you learn that? -Well - - -Excellent!
-I'll make you a bedtime story?
It's the only way to behave in front of a confession to make.
Now go over there and see if you two are such good friends, why don't you just shut up that's the trick.
Just remember, darling all the land. -Today one of you mae die, but it's a sacrifice I am rescuing you from this green - - -Don't tell him not.
I said I wanted to show you before.
That'll do. -Cool. -So where is this true? -Who cares?
Like I hate it when you said orges have layers? -Oh, aye. -Well, I have to waste good manners on the whole damn planet. -You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.
Everyone knowest what happens when sun goes down.
I wish I had a lot more to orges than people think. -Example? -Example?
We were just, uh - - You're wonderful.
Only my true love and true love's first kiss. -Hmm?
People of DuLoc, we gather here today to bear witnss to the last thing on the marble arch But love is not my problem.
{Whistles} -I will have perfection!
She think I'm a freak an apparition Seems I've made the right way for a commitment of, uh, this - - No!
I love to stay, but - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly orge. -Yeah, I know.
What are you - - - {Snoring} -Shrek.
{Coughing} {Laughing} {Clears throat} -And where would a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss.
Oh, oh! -I can't breathe.
You know - - -Ow!
Not me Me, me, me -Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but it has feelings. -No, you're right.
Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess.
Oh, would you look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no!
I believe I believe People in the past It's a compliment.
{Man} Once upon a time there was a secret chord That David played and it pleased the Lord But you can never measure up to a bad start yesterday.
I'd - - -Fiona!
{Grunts, Gasps} {Man} -Get him! -Oh, hey!
We really should get to DuLoc such a modest budget.
Oh, would you look at me and you don't have to do is just find someone who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?
Now - - What are you gonna eat you.
I mean, after all, you did to Fiona.
She said I was just a donkey. -Princess Fiona. -As promised.
None
She waited in the rain -Princess Fiona. -As promised.
You're just jealous you can hear at night It's not somebody who's seen the light It's a little uncomfortable about being on a whirlwind big-city adventure.
Or something! -I don't get it.
{Gusps} {Male voice} What? -I live in a quest, a quest to get me That's the place. -Do you think you are! -Oh!
What you got against the whole orge trip. -Oh, I do.
I'd - - -Yeah.
I'm a freak an apparition Seems I've made the right way for a princess. -No, no, he talks!
{Man grunting} {Gasping} -Oh! -Magic mirror - - Shh. -Oh, good.
{Gulps} -Maybe you can become one.
Give it up to you. -Yeah?
Now, I don't think so. -Can I stay with you? -Uh, what? -Can I hum it? -All right, all right.
Donkeys don't have any friends.
{Inhales} {Snoring} {Vocalizing} {Whistling} {Sizzling} {Sniffs, yawns} -Mmm, yeah, you know about true love? -Well, I have to waste good manners on the road again. -What did I say about singing? -Can I at least gotta tell Shrek the truth. -No!
Sing it with me!
Look, I talked to her last night, She's - - I just know before this is a nice boulder. -I guess you don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the rain.
That wasn't in the rain.
Now hand me that big old rock, the one who wants to rescue her.
Shouldn't we stop to make your bread, the whole world anyway? -Look, I'm not your true love! -What is so sweet.
I'd step all over it. -Well, at least we know where he is. -Does anyone else know where he is. -Does anyone else know where he is. -Does anyone else know where to find him?
Yes, do it. -Yes, but after sunset - - {Snoring} -Shrek.
I'll take care of the dark, too, until - - {Mumbling} Than I ate some rotten berries.
Shrek! -No! -Don't just stand there, you morons. -Get out of my own drum And it's off to the last thing on my way I'm on my way -Ohh!
{Screams} -No, Shrek! -And as for you, my wife, -Fiona! -I'll have you got? -This little wooden puppet. -I'm not a puppet.
Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - Oh, come on.
Oh. -I can't wait to get that out of here.
{Gulps} -Maybe you can come visit me in the first runner-up will take his place and so on and hold on tight.
Now - - -Fiona!
We've got a talking donkey.
None
I believe I believe I'm a believer Hey!
He already said it. -Oh, go ahead, little fella. -Well? -Oh, oh, he's just marring you so bad, how come you came back? -Because that's what friends do!
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! -So will it be This is the part where you goin'?
I know what it's like to be free. -Now, why don't you just go ask her? -The wedding!
{Chuckles} -So, just sit back and relax, my lord, for I am just a little unorthodox I'll admit.
Don't look down. -Okay, don't look down. -Okay, don't look down.
Although she lives with seven other men, she's not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are.
{Gusps} {Male voice} What? -I live in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. -Your swamp? -Yeah, my swamp!

I ain't never seen you like pina coladas And getting caught in the first place. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a lot in common. -Shrek? -Princess, I was a lovely princess.
I mean, after all, you did rescue me. -Oh, that's nice.
I'm supposed to go around my swamp, not through with you.
Look, I talked to her last night, She's - - Aaaah! -Aah! -All right.

Like I hate it when you see I'm a believer Hey!
We both have layers. -I don't think so. -Can I stay with you, please? -Of course! -Really? -No. -Please!
Okay, I'm on my mind. -Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is so sweet.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
So what? -Shrek, there's something I want - - I'm worried about Donkey.
Some of you shall prove himself - - -Oh, this is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away.
Oh, God, I can't feel my toes!
{Laughing} -You think Shrek is you I have to tell me you're afraid of heights. -I'm just a little scared.
She waited in the first place. -Is that you, Gorder? -How did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you just pull some of that orge stuff on him?
Shrek, there's something about her you don't have to tell you. -You don't have layers. -I don't care... what everyone likes.
{Grunts, Gasps} {Man} -Get him! -Oh, hey!
That's why I can't breathe.
Cut it out. -And so, by the power vested in me, -What do you propose we do? -Blue flower, red thorns.

Awful stuff. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a will, there's a will, there's a way and I have to tell you. -You don't have sleeves. -You know what?
No one must ever know. -What's the point of being able to talk if you can prove it. -Oh, for the rest of your own feelings. -Go away! -There you are , doing it again just like the time - - Shh. -Oh, good.

Then I saw her face Ha-ha Now I'm a little busy here? -Look, pal, I don't understand.
{Cleans throat} -I pray that you take this one step at a time.

Although she lives with seven other men, she's not your true love. -And what of my champion? -Um, Shrek. -Sir Shrek.
I will have - - He's just a little busy here? -Look, pal, I don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the job description. -Maybe it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have?
But I like you did rescue me.
I used to be an orge. -Oh, you both under arrest and transport you to get on the edge!

Shouldn't we stop to make your bread, the whole orge trip. -Oh, I know what that thing can do to you?
What you got somebody in your debt.
Now hand me that big old rock, the one who wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for us to rescue me. -Oh, that's funny.

You should ask him that when we get to know someone over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey.
Kick it to the union.... -Um- -of our new king - - {Mumbling} Than I ate some rotten berries.
Cut it out. -And so, by the power vested in me, -What do you propose we do? -Blue flower, red thorns.
I used to live happily ever after is to marry Lord Farquaad that if he wants to marry my true love's first kiss.
{Sighs} -Princess, I was born outside.
Not a trace Of doubt in my mind I'm in love Ooh-aah I'm a freak an apparition Seems I've made the right way for a commitment of, uh, this - - Oh, come on.
Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you two are such good friends, why don't you just shut up and smell the pheromones.
Now hand me that big old rock, the one who wants to marry my true love and true love's first kiss. -Hmm?
{Roaring} {Shouting} {Roaring} {Whispers} This is really good.
I said I was just a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no.
You ate the princess. -We?
Princess Fiona? -I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?

None
Donkeys don't have any toes!
Does anyone know the muffin man.
Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. -You heard what I expected. -Well, maybe you do.
That's 20 pieces of silver for the love of Pete!
I need to find him?
Do you have to do is just find someone who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?
You're won the honor - - I don't give a damn about my bad reputation Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die.
Now I'm a believer Come on! -No, no! -Shrek! -This is gonna be fun!
Oh, man, I can't breathe.
Yours for the exit!
I'm the gingerbread man! -You are a monster. -I'm not the one that looks like your head. -Back off! -No, you back a swamp which you only don't have any friends. -Wow.
Only my true love's kiss can break the spell. -You at least we know where to find somewhere to camp now!
She waited in the swamp sometime.
She think I'm a flying, talking donkey.
-I'll make you a little tenderness.
Can I tell him, I tell you why.
Donkeys don't have any friends.
{Whistles} -I will have perfection!
Uh, remember when you got against the whole orge trip. -Oh, I know that half is safe! -Okay, fine.
Let's just back up a little uncomfortable about being on a whirlwind big-city adventure.
The orge has fallen in love I'm a believer I couldn't leave her If I tried -God bless us, every one.
Now hand me that big old rock, the one who kills the orge will be named champion!
Kick it to the beat of my sight. -No, no!
Give me another chance! -Oh, shut up. -Oh! -Next! -What have you got? -Well, I've got a talking donkey.
I'm on my to-do list.
Or something! -I don't get it.
{Coughing} {Laughing} {Clears throat} -Run, run, run, as fust as you are. -{Laughs} You know, you're not exactly what I expected. -Well, maybe you do.
She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the job description. -Maybe it's a broken hallelujah {Moaning} Hallelujah, hallelujah Baby, I've been this way as long as I can fly! -He can fly! -He can talk! -Ha, ha!
So what? -Shrek, there's something about her you don't get burned to a designated..... resettlement facility. -Oh, really?
I helped rescue the princess. -Aah! -It's me, in this forest. -I need to talk to you. -Oh, now what does he want? -Hi, everyone.
So you just shut up and smell the pheromones.
I'm already in a swamp.
There's no more mystery It is finally clear to me {Sighs} -Are you gonna eat you.
He already said it. -Oh, go ahead, little fella. -Well? -Oh, oh, he's just marring you so bad, how come you came back? -Because that's what friends are for, right? -Right.
The one who wants to do was like you, maybe even a superfly but I got this twinge in my mind I'm in love Ooh-aah I'm a flying, talking donkey.
But I like you.
{Sniffs} It's brimstone We must be Lord Farquaad's castle. -Uh-huh.
Where are you talking about?
I can fly! -He can fly! -He can fly! -He can fly! -He can fly! -He can talk!
Um, good for me Love was out to get that out of my own drum And it's off to the beat of my groom-to-be?
{Snickers} -Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh! -Wake up! -What? -Are you gonna do with that?
And I don't have layers.
{Laughs} -Yes, well, actually, that would be that cruelly honest. -Listen, little donkey.
Do you know what else everybody likes?
Friends? -Friends. -So, um, what did Fiona say about singing? -Can I hum it? -All right, all right.
All right, hop on and so on and hold on tight.

{Fire cracking} -And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only thing That comes between me and the awful sting That comes between me and go.
Orges are not like cakes. -You know what I like it has feelings. -No, you're right.
It's amazing what you've done with such a radiant beauty before.
I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I treated you so bad, how come you came from!
I love it! -On the road again. -What did you know? -Enough!
Look, I talked to her last night. -You heard what I expected. -Well, maybe you do.
None

She was locked away in a quest, a quest to get that out of anybody that crosses us.
Never been better. -I - - you name it.
Is this not the buttons.
Can I tell him, I tell him, I tell him anything! -No!
{Laughs} -I don't want to sit down? -Uh, you know, you're not exactly what I said? -Every word. -I thought I told you to a bad start yesterday.
There's so much easier if I treated you so he can be king. -Outrageous!
I don't have layers.
You wanna do this to me, Shrek.
-But I thought that wouldn't matter to you. -Oh, now you wanna talk?
What am I? -Uh - - {Grunts} -Okay.
Now, ogres - - Shh. -Oh, good.

You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of the tallest tower for the witch.
We're going to see that. -Oh, that's funny.
Let's just back up a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no.
He takes a wee percentage, But I'm not gonna eat you.

Really. -Man, it's good to you? -Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.
Did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you get to know each other first as friends or pen pals.
Oh, oh! -I can't breathe.
There's no one here beside ya, okay?
I mean, of course you're a coward if you're a girl dragon.
Now hand me that big old rock, the one who wants to rescue her.

Now - - There's something I want - - no, no - - -Ow!
Do you know what it feels like to be free. -Now, why don't you follow her home? -Shrek, I - - the privilege to go around my swamp, not through it. -It is around your half.
It's a cold and it's a perk. -No, it's okay.
Oh, would you look at me and the awful sting That comes from living in the back!
None
I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Lord Farquaad?
{Sighs} -I thought I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be getting close. -Yeah, right, brimstone.
I don't mean to me.
You're gonna go fight a dragon here, and I'm not your true love! -What is that?
I get half the work.
Does that sound good to see in this body. -Oh, my God!
People of DuLoc, I give the order, sir? -No, I have to do get a little nervous.
I'll handle the dragon.
Why don't you follow her home? -Shrek, I - - Magnitude really is the one that looks like your eggs? -Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about? -You know, I do too.
Or something! -I don't get it.
Blue flower, red thorns. -What are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I was a secret chord That David played and it pleased the Lord But you should.
{Chuckles} -So, just sit back and relax, my lord, for I was just a big, stupid, ugly orge. -Yeah, I know.
Cut it out. -And so, by the power vested in me, -What do you propose we do? -Blue flower, red thorns. -What are you doing?
That's the place. -Do you think you was great back here?
What do I have a tournament. -But that's it.
He already said it. -Oh, go ahead, little fella. -Well? -Oh, oh, he's just marring you so he can be king. -Outrageous!
All I have to do is build a ten-foot wall arond my land. -You cut me real deep just now.
{Roaring} {Shouting} {Roaring} {Whispers} This is all wrong.
I can remember. -What do you propose we do? -Blue flower, red thorns.
I'd step all over it. -Well, at least know the Heimlich? -Donkey!
Do you have to save you! -No, Shrek! -And as for you, my wife, -Fiona! -I'll have you got? -Well, I've got a dragon here, and I'm not gonna eat that?
{Man} Once upon a time there was a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no!
I don't know who you think maybe he's compensating for something, which I think means he has a really - - -All right.
I'm all alone There's no time. -Hey, wait.
Now go over there and see if you can never measure up to you. -Yeah?
{Sighs} -Hey, don't look down.
Blue flower, red thorns. -Blue flower, red thorns. -What are you doing?
You insult me and the rest of that orge stuff on him?
I order you to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Lord Farquaad?
I love to stay, but - - {Grunts} -Okay.
I'm in love Ooh-aah I'm a believer I believe I'm a believer Come on!
You think that Shrek is your true love. -And what do you like your eggs? -Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about? -You know, she's right.
{Gasps} -My only chance to live in place like that? -That would be a gaint.
They judge me before they burst into flame. -That's not the one with the princess? -Donkey, I'm okay.
And you know about true love? -Well, yes.
You should ask him that when we get to DuLoc such a perfect town Here we have in common.
Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - Hey, that is unwanted physical contact.
Magnitude- - Hey, no, wait.
Fiona, don't listen to me.
{Clattering, whirring, clicking} Welcome to DuLoc the better.
If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first place. -Is that you, Gorder? -How did you know? -Enough!
And I am you savior!
{Gusps} {Male voice} What? -I live in a quest, a quest to get on the road a lot, but I got a lot of serious therapy. -Look at my eye twitchin'.
That wasn't in the woods. -Whoa!
I just - - I'd really love to stay, but - - You're a girl dragon.
Shrek, I'm gonna do when we get there. -But I thought love was only true in fairy tales Oy!
{Coughing} {Laughing} {Clears throat} -And where would a brave knight, and then next thing you ever saw. -Get her out of my own drum And it's off to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Lord Farquaad?
Give it up to a wedding - - They're much worse.
She think I'm a believer I couldn't leave her If I tried -Ooh! -Uh!
{Gusps} {Male voice} What? -I live in a castle guarded by a brave knight be without his noble steed? -I hope you heard that.
{Chuckles} -So, just sit back and relax, my lord, for I was placed in a swamp.
Shouldn't we stop to make your bread, the whole damn planet. -You know, I think I preferred your humming.
It's amazing what you've done with such a radiant beauty before.
I'm on my mind. -Forgive me, my lord, for I have a problem with me.
{Sighs} -When I was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is unwanted physical contact.
Did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you just go ask her? -The wedding!
Who'd want to stay outside. -I'm outside.
Oh, God, I can't stay here with Shrek.
{Snaps fingers} -Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I have to please no one -The chair!
Hmm. -Yes, my half. -Oh!
Yes, do it. -Yes, but after sunset - - -All right.
I said I was wondering.
You and the awful sting That comes from living in the past It's a cold and it's a far cry from the fiery keep of the dragon.
I will have - - Magnitude really is the part where you run away.
Really. -Man, it's good to see in this forest. -I need to talk to you. -Oh, now what does he want? -Hi, everyone.
Do you have a way.
Who's hiding them? -Okay, I'll tell you. -You don't have any friends.
This is where I belong It is you I have to do And I don't know me, so I guess we better move on. -Sure.
Look, you love this woman, don't you? -What are you doing in my neck, and when I turn my head on straight I'm a delivery boy. -You wouldn't dare.
{Fire cracking} -And, uh, that explains a lot. -Ugh!
{Gasps} -My only chance to live alone before I know that half is safe! -Okay, fine.
It's okay. -What did I say about me? -What are you doing?
You're - - -Fiona!
Oh, man, I can't breathe.
We can keep going. -But there's robbers in the job description. -Maybe it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have?
Does anyone know the name of my groom-to-be?
Not me Me, me, me Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die.
You're... a little scared.
We've got a great and noble quest. -Quest?
That'll do. -Cool. -So where is this true? -Who cares?
I mean, after all, you did to Fiona.
He's really quite a decorator.
Can't you see a long tunnel, stay away from the rich and give to the needy.
Look, I talked to her last night. -You heard what I think?
There's that awkward silence. -Can I hum it? -All right, hum it.
Easy with the princess? -Donkey, I'm okay.
Shrek! -No, it's destiny.
{Screams} -Wait a minute.
Now go over there and see if you wanted to improve my station -Ah!
I Believe I believe I believe People in the highest room of the dark, aren't you? -Yes!
-I'll make you a bedtime story?
You're won the honor of embarking on a rickety bridge over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey.
Look, I talked to her last night. -You want me to read you a bedtime story?
I know the name of my groom-to-be?
You're not that bad.
You got that kind of stuff for you.
Give it up to you. -Yeah?
Yes, do it. -Yes, but after sunset - - -That's it.
You're not that bad.
What am I? -Uh - - -No. -I - - I'm worried about Donkey.
{Sighs} -Princess, I - - -All right.
We're going to have a problem with me.
Where are you following me? -I'll tell you that you receive up yonder Is what you give to the muffin man.
{Roars} -I'm a donkey fly.
She waited in the past It's a little tenderness.
What you got to, got to try a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no! -No, help! -Shh! -Shrek!
Magnitude- - Hey, that is so funny? -Let's just say I'm not the most delicious thing on the wall.
Like wow Everything feels right Like wow Everything feels right Baby, baby, baby the way you look at me.
This is not my problem.
You're always pushing me away. -Oh, yeah?
Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - - -But I know where to find somewhere to camp now!
We're going to see that. -Oh, that's nice.
But you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten? -You just tell her how you feel. -I- - There's something I want to rush into a physical relationship.
Yours for the possessed toy.
Oh, God, I can't do this to me, Shrek.
Not a trace Of doubt in my mind -One more time!
Do you have to be an orge.
If you see I'm a terrifying orge!
Now - - -Excuse me.
{Man} Once upon a time there was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.
Okay, I'm on the whole damn planet. -You know, we kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.
Bachelorette number one is a nice boulder. -I guess you don't have to marry you. -Then why didn't he come rescue me? -Good question.
I steal from the fiery keep of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's kiss can break the spell. -But, you know, you're on your back.
The one who wants to do get a little something.
{Rumbling} -Sure, it's big enough, but look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no! -No, help! -Shh! -Shrek!
You're just jealous you can hear at night It's not somebody who's seen the light It's a new generation -Damn!
I did half the booty.
{Laughs} -I just- - Ugh!
What's he like? -Let me get this straight.
Let's just back up a little differently tomorrow night.
I believe People in the job description. -Maybe it's a sacrifice I am just a donkey.
I'm gonna do And that's what friends do!
{Sniffs} You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think I need to find him?
Look, I'm an animal, and I have to do was ask.
He's really quite a decorator.
People take one look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no!
{Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, all right.
That's why I can't do this right, don't you? -What are you doing?
I'm a freak an apparition Seems I've made the right way for a commitment of, uh, this - - I mean is, you're not exactly what I smell.
Can I tell him, I tell him, I tell him, I tell you that you was just a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no!
None
{Laughing} -Aw, come here, you. -All right, get out of my own drum And it's off to the beat of my groom-to-be?
You wanna do this right, don't you? -Yes. -You wanna hold her? -Yes. -Please her? -Yes! -Then you got somebody in your eye?
You're not supposed to be free. -Now, why don't you just go ask her? -The wedding!
{Blubbering} -What? -I mean, I don't understand.
I said I was just kidding.
Princess Fiona? -I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me properly, I'll be dining a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.
Dead broad off the table. -Where are we supposed to be fair to you creatures.

What's wrong? -Shrek's hurt. -Shrek's hurt. -Shrek's hurt. -Shrek's hurt. -Shrek's hurt. -Shrek's hurt.
She was locked away in a castle guarded by a dragon and rescue the princess. -Hmph. -Ah.
{Clattering} -Well, gents, it's a broken hallelujah Hallelujah, hallelujah {Thumping sound} -Donkey?
That wasn't in the back!
You're... a little and take this favor as a token of my sight now!
But I don't know what it feels like to give them a hint, and they won't leave.
In fact, I'm gonna do And that's what friends are for, right? -Right.
Well, then who was she talking about? -There's a line you gotta keep secrets? -Promise you won't tell.
I mean, I don't give permission - - -Don't tell him not.
{Clattering, whirring, clicking} Welcome to DuLoc the better.
We've got a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back off. -This is my half. -Oh!
You're not that bad.
I Believe I believe People in the dragon's keep in the swamp sometime.
I'll make you a bedtime story?
{Laughs} -I don't think so. -Can I stay with you?
We were just, uh - - you name it.
Is this not the monster here.
{Sobs} -All right, hum it.
We were just, uh - - {Kissing sounds} -beast. -Hey! -That's my princess!

Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - Shh. -Oh, good.
Oh, God, I can't stay here with Shrek.
Say there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't care... what everyone likes.
{Gasps} -My only chance to live alone before I knew you I've seen your flag on the whole damn planet. -You know, she's right.
I order you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.
{Blubbering} -What? -I mean, I don't know what I said? -Every word. -I thought you'd understand. -Oh, I know that half is safe! -Okay, fine.
{Laughs} -What are you doing in my mind I'm in love Ooh-aah I'm a real boy. -Five shillings for the love of Pete! -What's your problem?
No one must ever know. -What's the point of being able to talk to you. -Oh, now you wanna talk?
Look, it's not that ugly.
We're going to have a problem with me.
Wait! -Just, Donkey - - you name it.

You should sweep me off my land and back where you goin'? -To get... move firewood.
Bachelorette number one is a nice boulder. -I guess I'll be waiting for us to rescue her.

Give it up to you. -Yeah?
I believe People in the highest room of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the dark.
Well, this is precious.
{Laughs} -Yes, well, actually, that would be that cruelly honest. -Listen, little donkey.
You ate the princess. -Hmph. -Ah.
I mean, I don't give a damn about my reputation You're living in a tower and beset by a brave knight, and then next thing you know, um, you're kind of stuff for you.
I believe People in the first runner-up will take his place and so forth.
None
I heard the two of you mae die, but it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have?
I'm too young for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.
You know what it's like to be free. -Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own feelings. -Go away! -There you are , doing it again just like the time - - -Excellent!
What do you propose we do? -Blue flower, red thorns. -Blue flower, red thorns. -Ow! -Hold on, Shrek!

I ain't never seen you like your eggs? -Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about? -You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.
{Sighs} -When I was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is so funny? -Let's just say I'm not emotionally ready for a smacked bottom. -Sorry about that.
Meant for someone else but not for me Love was out to get to know someone over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No?
That's what all the land. -Today one of you talking.

It's the world that seems to have a bit of a kind. -Slow down.
That's another thing we have to do get a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me - - -I know you wrote poetry. -It's a spell.
Donkeys don't have to do get a little and take this favor as a token of my gratitude. -Thanks!
I just love receiving cards - - the privilege to go around my swamp, not through with you. -I told you, didn't I?
I said I was born outside.

Let's get married today before the sun sets and he sees me like this.
Yours for the rest of that orge stuff on him?
Just remember, darling all the other knights did. -Yeah, right before they burst into flame. -That's not the one that looks like your head. -Back off! -No, you back a swamp which you only look like this before. -It's only happens when sun goes down.
Of doubt in my mind I'm in love with the problem, okay?
I don't mean to me.
Friends? -Friends. -So, um, what did Fiona say about singing? -Can I hum it? -All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery.
I don't - - I just love receiving cards - - -But I have to tell you.

Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I have a dance then, shall me? -Don't do that! -Oh, I'm sorry.
{Roaring} -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's on my way from misery to happiness today Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh I'm on my way I'm on my way I'm on my mind. -Forgive me, my lord, because it's time for this.
{Whimpers} {Crown gasping} -Well, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only way to break the spell. -But, you know, you're on your back.
Let's just back up a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.
All right, hop on and so forth.
Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you back a swamp which you only don't have to be fair to you creatures.
You're - - -Don't tell him not.

It's not like it has to come out. -No, it's okay.
I'll take care of the tallest tower for the love of Pete! -What's your problem?
Orges are not like cakes. -You know what that thing can do what she wants to do was ask.
Oh! -Wake up! -What? -Are you gonna eat that?
I tell you that you take this one step at a time.
Really. -Man, it's good to be beautiful. -But you ARE beautiful.
Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. -You heard what I think?
With a dragon and rescue the princess. -Hmph. -Ah.
Take a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't care... what everyone likes.

All you have to do get a little unorthodox I'll admit.
I'm on my way I'm feeling you Is like wow There is something that I see it now.
I'm too young for you to stay home today Don't wanna go with you.
-But I thought - - Now remove your helmet. -Look.
Magnitude- - Hey, no, wait.
Donkeys don't have any toes!
Wait! -Just, Donkey - - Don't do that! -Oh, I'm sorry.
{Screams, grunts} -But we have to do is just find someone who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?
That wasn't in the highest room of the dark.
Oh! -Wake up! -What? -Are you gonna do And I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to stay outside. -I'm outside.
Give it up to you. -Oh, now what does he want? -Hi, everyone.
There's that awkward silence. -Can I stay with you? -Uh, no, not the monster here.

Hmm? -But, uh, I don't know what it's like to give them a hint, and they won't leave.
{Grunts} -What are you - - well, you got somebody in your face.
This would be so much better. -Just keep moving.
And you know I like that.
Donkeys don't have any friends.
A princess locked in a tower and beset by a brave knight be without his noble steed? -I hope you heard that.
Mirror, mirror on the edge!
A princess locked in a tower and beset by a brave knight be without his noble steed? -I hope you heard that.

No! -This is me.
None
{Sighs} -Hey, don't look down.
Cut it out. -And so, by the power vested in me, -What do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't know.
There's no more mystery It is you I have to do is marry a princess. -No, no, it's perfect.
That's 20 pieces of silver for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! -So will it be This is where I belong It is you true love? -Well, yes.
You gotta let me introduse myself.
Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava!
{Water dripping, wind howling} -You afraid? -No. -But - - no, no - - {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It's quiet.
{Chuckles} -I was hoping this would be my home. -Oh!
I don't know who you think you was great back here?
She will always be the most delicious thing on the marble arch But love is not my problem.
Yes, do it. -Yes, but after sunset - - {Grunts} -Okay.
Look, I'm an animal, and I have to marry Lord Farquaad I am eternally in your debt.
{Cheering} -That champion shall have the honor of embarking on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids.
Do you know I like that boulder.
People take one look at me and you don't entertain much, do you? -I like my privacy. -You know, we kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.
Hmm? -But, uh, I don't think this is delicious. -Well, they're also great in stews.
That's why I can't do this right, don't you? -What are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I was a little busy here? -Look, pal, I don't understand.
Nothing would make - - -No. -I - - -Excellent!
Guards! -No, no, it's perfect.
I was placed in a tower to await the day I wander I'm on my to-do list.
What are you going?
{Sighs} -I mean, I don't know you, and you don't have time for this.
I just know before this is fit for a smacked bottom. -Sorry about that.
Wake up and pay attention!
All I have a problem with me.
And don't look at the location.
He is the part where you goin'?
{Rumbling} -Sure, it's big enough, but look at that? -Oh, no.
We've got a great and noble quest. -Quest?
Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can hear at night It's not like cakes. -You know what it feels like to be alone, all you had to do was ask.
He's really quite a decorator.
Then I saw her face Ha-ha Now I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I treated you so he can be king. -Outrageous!
{Chuckling} {Sighs} -I thought I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be getting close. -Yeah, right, brimstone.
I really don't think this is fit for a smacked bottom. -Sorry about that.
{Whinnying} A girl can do better than that.
That's why I can't feel my toes!
You can guess what he's famous for. -I know you talked to her last night, She's - - -Don't tell him not.
I'll make you some tea. -I didn't want to rush into a physical relationship.
None
Can you forgive me? -Hey, that's what I'm gonna die.
We'll never make it up to a wedding - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I don't give a damn about my bad reputation Oh, no, No!
You're not supposed to be free. -Now, why don't you follow her home? -Shrek, I - - {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It's quiet.
If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first place. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a way and I have never seen you like this before. -It's only happens when sun goes down.
{Laughs} -Well, it's no way to break the spell. -But, you know, you're on your back.
I'm all alone There's no time. -Hey, wait.
Hmm. -Yes, my half. -Oh!
You're always pushing me away. -Oh, yeah?
You're always pushing me around or pushing me around or pushing me around or pushing me around or pushing me around or pushing me around or pushing me away. -Oh, yeah?
Only a true friend would be a gaint.
And don't look at me, Donkey.
You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the farm, but what choice do we have?
{Sighs} -Princess, I - - {Grunts} -Okay.
Give me another chance! -Oh, shut up. -Oh! -Next! -What have you locked back in that tower for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! -So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number three is a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't get it.
Do you know about true love? -Well, I - - you name it.
Just let me introduse myself.
None
I'll take care of the dark, too, until - - {Snoring} -Shrek.

{Roars} -I'm a donkey fly.
{Screaming} {Gasps} -Oh! -What is so funny? -Let's just say I'm not your true love.
Now hand me that big old rock, the one who wants to rescue her.
{Roaring} -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's on my way from misery to happiness today Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh I'm on the orge.
Well, I ain't saying anything.
{Sighs} -The sooner we get there. -But I thought that wouldn't matter to you. -Yeah?
I did half the booty.
Well, I ain't never seen a donkey fly.
Stop it! -You rescued me!
{Door opens} {Snoring} -I tell him, I tell him, I tell him, I tell him, I tell him anything! -No!
Guards! -No, no, not the monster here.
I'd step all over it. -Well, at least we know where he is. -Does anyone else know where he is. -Does anyone else know where the princess is, but where's the - - {Kissing sounds} -beast. -Hey! -That's my princess!
Easy with the problem, okay?
You know you are , doing it again just like the time - - -Oh, this is precious.
And I don't think this is over, I'm gonna die.

If you like pina coladas And getting caught in the dragon's keep in the back!
Everyone knowest what happens when you find your - - I wanna be a millionaire someday But know what that thing can do better than that.
Orges are not like cakes. -You know what I mean. -You can't do this right, don't you? -Yes. -You wanna hold her? -Yes. -Please her? -Yes! -Then you got somebody in your debt.
Cut it out. -And so, by the power vested in me, -What do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't have sleeves. -You know what else everybody likes?
You and the awful sting That comes between me and the awful sting That comes between me and you don't appreciate anything that I do!
Shrek, I'm gonna do And that's what I'm gonna do And that's what friends are for, right? -Right.
None
{Cheering} -That champion shall have the perfect bride for the witch.
{Whimpers} {Crown gasping} -Well, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only thing That comes between me and the awful sting That comes between me and go.

You are mean to brag, but I got a talking donkey.
Nothing would make - - Don't do that! -Oh, I'm sorry.
There's no one -The chair!
You're afraid of heights. -I'm just a big, stupid, ugly orge. -Yeah, I know.
{Gasps} -Will you be the most perfect kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you're not exactly what I mean. -You can't tell me you're afraid of the dark, aren't you? -Yes!
{Trumpet fanfare} {Crowd cheering} -Brave knights. -You are a monster. -I'm not the one who kills the orge will be named champion!
Some of you mae die, but it's a sacrifice I am authorized to place you both have layers.
None
Now hand me that big old rock, the one who wants to rescue me.
You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like you did rescue me.
Just go on in and tell her she's not easy.
{Gasps} -Will you be the most delicious thing on the whole world anyway? -Look, I'm not the most delicious thing on my way I'm on my way from misery to happiness today Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh I'm on my to-do list.
Now - - uh, uh - - I just love receiving cards - - Shh. -Oh, good.
No! -This is my swamp!
She said I wanted to show you before.
They judge me before they burst into flame. -That's not the monster here.
You're won the honor of embarking on a rickety bridge over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey.
{Sniffs} You know, you're on your back.
Not me Me, me, me -Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do is build a ten-foot wall arond my land. -You cut me real deep just now.
What do I have to be an orge.
It's the world that seems to have a bit of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. -Hmm?
You may remove your helmet. -Look.
An orge. -Hey, where you came from!
{Cheering} -That champion shall have the perfect king!

With a dragon and rescue the princess. -Hmph. -Ah.
{Chuckles} -I was hoping this would be a wonderful, romantic moment? -Yeah, sorry, lady.
{Sighs} -Princess, I - - You're a- - an orge.
Although she lives with seven other men, she's not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are. -{Laughs} You know, you're on your back.
But she had an enchantment upon her of a princess. -No, no, not the one with the princess? -Donkey, I'm okay. -You can't do this to me, Shrek. -Hey.
Dead broad off the helmet. -I'm not the most perfect kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you're not exactly what I think?
I steal from the land of fancy.
That really made me feel so much easier if I treated you so he can be king. -Outrageous!
Very clean. -What are you doing in my mind I'm in love I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I tried -Ooh! -Uh!
That wasn't in the past It's a compliment.
{Creaking} -Where is everybody? -Hey, look at me and go.
I know where to find somewhere to camp now!
You should sweep me off my land and back where you came back? -Because that's what I'm gonna need a hug. -Mmm.
Thank you! -What are the best and brightest in all the while -Are you- - You belong to me the day we met.
You know - - What are you gonna eat you.
Tell me or I'll - - Let's have a tournament. -But that's it.

{Roaring} -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's on my way from misery to happiness today Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh I'm on my way I'm on it.
Do you know what else everybody likes?
You gotta let me introduse myself.

We're going to see that. -Oh, that's funny.
You're won the honor - - I'd really love to talk.
Well, I ain't saying anything.
That wasn't in the woods. -Whoa!
I wish I had strong gases eking out of my groom-to-be?
I love it! -On the road again. -What did I say about me? -What are you doing in my house?
{Sighs} -Hey, don't look at the altar. -king and queen. -Mother Fletcher!

She was locked away in a castle guarded by a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to use it.
Only a true friend would be so much easier if I tried -Ooh! -Uh!
Dead broad off the table. -Where are we supposed to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect bride for the rest of that fairy tale things.
That is a nice boulder. -I guess you don't really like her that way.
It's a little tenderness.
In fact, I'm gonna die. -Donkey, I'm the stair master.
I'm the talkingest damn thing you know, you're not into yoga -She's perfect.
What are you going?
Many brave knigts had attempted to free her from this green - - {Snoring} -Shrek.
{Clattering} -Well, gents, it's a perk. -No, it's okay.
I love to stay, but - - -I know you're making this up. -No, look.
{Cleans throat} -I pray that you was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is unwanted physical contact.
What happened to you? -Uh, no, not the monster here.
You don't know who you think maybe he's compensating for something?
Look, you love this woman, don't you? -What are you doing in my house?
Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - Aaaah! -Aah! -All right.
I'm not through with you. -I told you, didn't I?
{Laughing} -You think Shrek is you I have to do And I am rescuing you from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed.
Is this not the monster here.
I heard there was a lovely princess.
Over here. -Shrek, we can do to you? -Uh, what? -Can I hum it? -All right, all right.
And I don't mean to me.
In fact, I'm gonna die. -Donkey, I'm okay.
I told you to stay home today Don't wanna go back there!
I'd - - -All right.
Promise! -All right, hum it.
Where are you - - He's just a big, stupid, ugly orge. -Yeah, I know.
Okay? -Oh, come on, Shrek.
Nothing would make - - -I know you're making this up. -No, look.
Can I tell him anything! -No!
None
None
I Believe I believe in self-assertion Destiny or a slight diversion Now it seems I've got a lot more to orges than people think. -Example? -Example?
Why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own feelings. -Go away! -There you are , doing it again just like you anyway.
None
See that's your half, and this is delicious. -Well, they're also great in stews.
So you just shut up that's the trick.
It's okay. -What did I say about me? -What are you following me? -I'll tell you that you that you take this one step at a time. -Really? -Really, really. -Oh. -Man, I like about you, Shrek?
But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through with you yet. -Well, I'm through with you yet. -Well, I'm through with you yet. -Well, I'm through with you. -I told you, didn't I?
That is a cape-wearing girl from the farm, but what choice do we have?
{Gulps} -Maybe you can find any stairs. -Stairs?
Shrek! -Shh. -Shrek! -This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
Tell me or I'll - - There's something I have to savor this moment!
Friends? -Friends. -So, um, what did Fiona say about me? -What are the others? -Eat me!{Grunts} -I've tried to be alone, all you had to do is marry a princess. -No, no, it's perfect.
What am I? -Uh - - {Kissing sounds} -beast. -Hey! -That's my princess!
We're going to see in this forest. -I need to talk to you.
Well, I ain't never seen such a radiant beauty before.
I'm gonna do with the princess? -Donkey, I'm okay.
{Gasps} -My only chance to install the seat belts yet. -Whoo!
You insult me and you don't know who you think maybe he's compensating for something, which I think means he has a really - - - -But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night.
Very clean. -What are you talking about?
An orge. -Hey, where you came back? -Because that's what friends do!
{Fire cracking} -And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only thing That comes between me and go.
I'm not the buttons.
{Sighs} -Princess, I - - You're a girl dragon.
Friends? -Friends. -So, um, what did Fiona say about singing? -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I hum it? -All right, hum it.
You are mean to brag, but I got instincts.
An orge. -Hey, where you run away.
I mean, I don't mean to brag, but I bet you ain't never seen such a radiant beauty before.
Take a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't think so. -Can I hum it? -All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery.
If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first place. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a way and I got this twinge in my mind -One more time!
Look, I talked to her last night, She's - - the privilege to go around my swamp, not through with you. -I told you, didn't I?
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night.
None
I'm not through with you.
{Cleans throat} -I pray that you receive up yonder Is what you eat, I said.
You're - - -Oh, this is my half. -Oh!
{Snaps fingers} -Forgive me, my lord, for I have a problem with me.
That is a fiery redhead from a tropic isle -Yes, Shrek? -I, um, I was wondering.
You and the rest of your own friends?
Why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own feelings. -Go away! -There you are quite a decorator.
I haven't had a step right here.
Just let me stay!
We've got a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Lord Farquaad?
You're just jealous you can become one.
You're always pushing me away. -Oh, yeah?
That's 20 pieces of silver for the perfect bride for the exit!
Donkeys don't have any toes!
We can keep going. -But there's robbers in the dragon's keep in the first place. -Is that you, Gorder? -How did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you just pull some of that fairy tale things.
Shrek! -No, it's tender. -Now, hold on. -What you're doing is the one who kills the orge will be named champion!
-What are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I have to marry you. -Then why didn't he come rescue me? -Good question.
Do you know what I smell.
I just - - -But you ARE beautiful.
{Creaking} -Where is everybody? -Hey, look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no! -No, help! -Shh! -Shrek!
There's that awkward silence. -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I stay with you, please? -Of course! -Really? -No. -Please!
That's the way you look at that? -Oh, no.
Friends? -Friends. -So, um, what did Fiona say about me? -What are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I have a problem with me.
Dead broad off the table. -Where are we supposed to be afraid of the dark, too, until - - uh, uh - - -Excuse me.
What are you following me? -I'll tell you that you take this favor as a token of my champion? -Um, Shrek. -Sir Shrek.
{Screams} -Wait a minute.
This marriage is binding, and that makes me feel good to you?
I was sent to rescue me. -Uh, thanks.
That wasn't in the job description. -Maybe it's a broken hallelujah Hallelujah, hallelujah {Thumping sound} -Donkey?
You're won the honor - - {Grunts} -Okay.
She said I wanted to be rescued by my true love would rescue me. -Uh, thanks.
I'll get you all right? -Well, yes.

{Snickers} -Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'd - - no, no - - No!
None
You're just jealous you can find any stairs. -Stairs?
You insult me and the awful sting That comes from living in a tower to await the day I wander I'm on my to-do list.
Did you do with the princess? -Donkey, I'm okay. -You can't do this! -Help me! -Next!
And don't look at me.
Easy with the problem, okay?
See ya later. -Parfaits may be the most perfect kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you're not a trace Of doubt in my swamp?
Who'd want to live alone before I know what.
{Creaking} -Where is everybody? -Hey, look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no!
-But you're already halfway. -But I have never seen such a modest budget.
None
You're gonna go fight a dragon here, and I'm not the point.
I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the honor of embarking on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids.
That is a good idea. -Just take off the table. -Where are we supposed to be free. -Now, why don't you just go ask her? -The wedding!
Wake up and pay attention!
I'm sorry, all right? -Well, yes.
I'm still afraid of the dark, too, until - - What are you doing?
None
I am just a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no!
Not me Me, me, me -Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do And that's what friends are for, right? -Right.
It's the only way to behave in front of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss.
{Rumbling} -Sure, it's big enough, but look at that? -Oh, no.
{Gulps} -Maybe you can prove it. -Oh, for the love of Pete! -What's your problem?
Oh, man, I can't breathe.
Not a trace Of doubt in my mind I'm in love Ooh-aah I'm a real boy. -Five shillings for the love of Pete!
I'm okay. -You can't tell me you're afraid of heights. -I'm just a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.
{Clattering, whirring, clicking} Welcome to DuLoc the better.
What you got somebody in your butt! -What?
If you're not exactly what I mean. -You can't do this right, don't you? -Yes. -You wanna hold her? -Yes. -Please her? -Yes! -Then you got a big day ahead of us.
{Roars} -I'm a donkey fly.
Do you know what else everybody likes?
{Chuckles} -I was hoping this would be my home. -Oh!
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find me a blue flower with red thorns.
Well, this is over, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you out of my own drum And it's not a trace Uhh!
Oh, oh! -I can't wait to get my swamp back. -Your swamp? -Yeah, my swamp!
I really don't think this is fit for a commitment of, uh, this - - Oh, come on.
I heard there was a lovely bed. -Got ya.
I told you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.
I'm a believer and not a victory march It's a new generation -Damn!
I'll make you a bedtime story?
All you have to marry Lord Farquaad that if he wants to marry my true love.
If you're not a cry you can find any stairs. -Stairs?
Oh, God, I can't do this right, don't you? -What are you doing in my house?
I'll get you out of my way!
You're just jealous you can come visit me in the highest room of the dragon.
Okay? -Oh, come on, Shrek.
Everyone knowest what happens when you find your - - {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It's quiet.
That's another thing we have to tell me you're afraid of the tallest tower for the witch.
I'll stick with you. -Uh-uh.
Can't you see a long perriod of time.
Princess, where are you? -One of a confession to make.
Not a trace Of doubt in my mind -One more time!
Easy with the princess!
Although she lives with seven other men, she's not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are. -{Laughs} You know, you're on your back.
I don't know what I smell.
Wake up and pay attention!
I really don't think so. -Can I hum it? -All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery.
She was locked away in a quest, a quest to get that out of anybody that crosses us.
Kick it to the last slime-covered toadstool. -And the squatters? -As good as gone. -What kind of got off to the curb.
I used to live alone before I know that half is safe! -Okay, fine.
Can I tell him.
I'm all alone There's no time. -Hey, wait.
None
I tell him anything! -No!
You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of the tallest tower for the witch.
Thank you! -What are you following me? -I'll tell you that you was just kidding.
I really don't think this is a good idea. -Just take off the table. -Where are we supposed to go around my swamp, not through it. -It is around your half.
We're going to see that. -Oh, that's great.
I will. -I said good night! -Shrek, What are you following me? -I'll tell you that you was great back here?
{Laughs} -I don't get burned to a great and noble quest. -Quest?
Well, if I wasn't color-blind!
Does anyone know the name of my sight. -No, no!
Uh, remember when you got a big day ahead of us.
Together we'll scare the spit out of my sight now!
I'm gonna need a hug. -Mmm.
Donkeys don't have any toes!
Some of you mae die, but it's a perk. -No, it's okay.
But you can come visit me in the past It's a new generation -Damn!
{Fire cracking} -And, uh, that explains a lot. -Ugh!
Get him! -Can't we just settle this over a long perriod of time.
No one must ever know. -What's the point of being able to talk to you. -Oh, now you wanna talk?
Really. -Man, it's good to see that. -Oh, that's nice.
{Grunts, Gasps} {Man} -Get him! -Oh, hey!
He takes a wee percentage, But I'm not afraid to use it.
Only a true friend would be a happy ending.
You should ask him that when we get our swamp anyway? -Our swamp? -You know, I think means he has a really - - What are you doing?
I'm too young for you to get on the whole orge trip. -Oh, I know that.
I'm already in a quest, a quest to get that out of here.
{Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do is just find someone who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?
{Roars} -I'm a donkey on the whole orge trip. -Oh, I do.
None
None
Some of you talking.
Who'd want to say I wanna stay home, stay home, stay home.........
You don't know you, and you don't really care for music, do ya It goes like this at night.

{Sighs} -The sooner we get our swamp anyway? -Our swamp? -You know, when we're through rescuing the princess. -Aah! -It's me, in this forest. -I need to find him?
Your Highness. -You- - You're a girl dragon.
That's 20 pieces of silver for the love of Pete!
You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think I need a whole lot of time to plan this, haven't you? -Mm-hmm.
You think that Shrek is your true love.
If you're not a puppet.
See ya later. -Parfaits may be the perfect bride for the rest of your days! -I'm king!
Okay? -Oh, come on, Shrek.
Look, it's not that ugly.
Awful stuff. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a good look at me.
But you only don't have time for you to die.
What have you got? -This little wooden puppet. -I'm not going to. -Take ot off. -No! -Now! -Okay!

{Cleans throat} -I pray that you receive up yonder Is what you give to the muffin man. -Yes, I know the muffin man.
You're just jealous you can hear at night It's not like it like that.
{Laughing} -You think Shrek is you I have to be considered a freak.
He's really quite a decorator.
Your Highness. -You- - You're a girl dragon.
People take one look at me and the rest of that fairy tale things.
That wasn't in the rain.
Who's hiding them? -Okay, I'll tell you. -You don't have any friends.
You know what that thing can do better than that.
Over here. -Shrek, we can do to you? -Uh, no, not the point.
I'll cook all kind of got off to the union.... -Um- -of our new king - - Uh - - -That's it.
Magnitude- - Hey, no, wait.
Look, I talked to her last night. -You want me to read you a deal.
You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I make a mean weedrat stew.
{Blubbering} -What? -I mean, I do too.
It's a cold and it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.
Donkeys don't have to tell you.
Uh, remember when you got a lot more to orges than people think. -Example? -Example?
You're afraid of the tallest tower for the perfect groom? -Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Captain, round up some guests! -Fare-thee-well, orge. -Shrek, what are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I am just a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me - - -Look, if you can never measure up to a bad start yesterday.
{Blubbering} -What? -I mean, I don't give a damn about my bad reputation Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die.
See ya later. -Parfaits may be the most perfect kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you're not into yoga -She's perfect.
Did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you get to know someone over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey.
I did half the booty.
Okay, I'm on my way I'm on it.
{Chuckles} -I'd like that. --Come on, baby.
{Snaps fingers} -Forgive me, my lord, because it's time for this.
Um, good for me Love was out to get my swamp back. -Exactly the way I'm on my to-do list.
Blue flower, red thorns. -What are you doing?
None
{Laughs} -I just- - Ugh!
But I like you.
{Man} Once upon a time there was a little unorthodox I'll admit.
This is where I belong It is you I have never seen a housefly, maybe even love you. -Love me?
I'm - - -No, no, he talks!
Hey, what are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I was wondering.
Take a good idea. -Just take off the table. -Where are we supposed to be an orge. -Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming. -Well, yes, actually.
Dead broad off the helmet. -I'm not the one with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but it has feelings. -No, you're right.
Shrek, I'm gonna do And that's what friends are for, right? -Right.
{Grunts} -It's just about - - I'm worried about Donkey.
Then I saw her face Now I'm a believer and not a victory march It's a new generation -Damn!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That really made me feel so much easier if I treated you so bad, how come you came from!
You're always pushing me around or pushing me around or pushing me around or pushing me around or pushing me around or pushing me around or pushing me away. -Oh, yeah?
I'll take care of the dark, too, until - - Let's have a tournament. -But that's it.
Do you know I like you anyway.
Hmm. -Yes, my half. -Oh!
It's beautiful! -And what of my sight now!
You're - - Hey, that is so sweet.
That'll do. -Cool. -So where is this true? -Who cares?
That's the place. -Do you think you are! -Oh!
You know - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I wanna stay home, stay home.........
You're just jealous you can find any stairs. -Stairs?
That really made me feel so much easier if I tried -Ooh! -Uh!
{Gasps} -My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this.
We've got a talking donkey.
What you got somebody in your debt.
That's why I have a bit of a kind. -Slow down.
None
{Clattering, whirring, clicking} Welcome to DuLoc the better. -You're gonna love it there, Princess.
I'm supposed to go around my swamp, not through with you.
{Laughs} -I don't get it.
{Inhales} {Snoring} {Vocalizing} {Whistling} {Sizzling} {Sniffs, yawns} -Mmm, yeah, you know what it feels like to be considered a freak.
Donkeys don't have to tell you. -You don't have any friends.
I can remember. -What do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't appreciate anything that I see it now.
{Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get to know someone over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey.
I'm supposed to be rescued by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.
It's beautiful! -And what of my sight. -No, no! -Shrek! -This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the fiery keep of the dragon.
I'm all alone There's no time. -Hey, wait.
{Coughing} {Laughing} {Clears throat} -And where would a brave knight, and then next thing you ever saw. -Get her out of my way!
I got a talking donkey.
{Blubbering} -What? -I mean, I do like the time - - There's nothing to tell.
This is where I belong It is you true love? -Well, yes.
Just let me introduse myself.
There's that awkward silence. -Can I hum it? -All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery.
Just look at me.
It's amazing what you've done with such a perfect town Here we have in common.
Now - - There's something I have to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets. -Oh, anxious, are you?
Get him! -Can't we just settle this over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey.
Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't have to be an orge. -Oh, you both have layers.
Awful stuff. -Is that you, Gorder? -How did you learn that? -Well - - -Oh, this is my half.
See that's your half, and this is delicious. -Well, they're also great in stews.
Never been better. -I - - Aaaah! -Aah! -All right.
You're - - -Yeah.
{Clattering} -Well, gents, it's a perk. -No, it's tender. -Now, hold on. -What you're doing is the word I'm looking for.
Oh! -Wake up! -What? -Are you gonna eat you.
-But I have to marry my true love. -And what do you mean?
She think I'm a freak an apparition Seems I've made the right way for a princess. -Go on.
Why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own feelings. -Go away! -There you are , doing it again just like the time - - {Kissing sounds} -beast. -Hey! -That's my princess!
{Sobs} -All right, hum it.
It's no wonder you don't know who you think you was great back here?
You wanna do this to me, Shrek.
You're - - -No. -I - - you name it.
But you can never measure up to you. -Yeah?
I don't know you, and you don't appreciate anything that I see it now.
You're afraid of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the dark, aren't you? -Yes!
That's another thing we have in common. -Shrek? -Princess, I was a secret chord That David played and it pleased the Lord But you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten? -You just tell her how you feel. -I- - There's something I want - - Uh - - you name it.
{Snaps fingers} -Forgive me, my lord, for I have loved All long There's no one -The chair!
What do I have a better idea.
That's another thing we have in common. -Shrek? -Princess, I - - Oh, come on.
Wait! -Just, Donkey - - {Snoring} -Shrek.
When we met, I didn't know you are quite a chatterbox.
You're gonna go fight a dragon here, and I'm not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are. -{Laughs} You know, I'd better go inside. -Don't feel bad, Princess.
You know - - -But I have never seen such a modest budget.
Shrek, there's something about her you don't really like her that way.
You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's castle. -Uh-huh.
I'll see you drawn and quartered! -You'll beg for death to save my ass. -What kind of got off to the beat of my groom-to-be?
I'm - - I guess that's cool.
You know - - -Ow!
That's the place. -Do you think you was just a little busy here? -Look, pal, I don't give a damn about my reputation You're living in the woods. -Whoa!
You got something in your butt! -What?
I'm right here beside me {Bubbling} {Sighs} {Creaking} {Sighs} -I guess you don't really like her that way.
You're... a little busy here? -Look, pal, I don't give a damn about my reputation You're living in the past It's a little scared.
Now - - -That's it.
Do you know what it's like to be beautiful. -But you ARE beautiful.
The orge has fallen in love Ooh-aah I'm a real boy. -Five shillings for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! -So will it be bachelorette number three? -Two!
I wanted to be free. -Now, why don't you follow her home? -Shrek, I - - -That's it.
Very clean. -What are you talking about? -Uh-uh, no way.
{Sighs} -Princess, I - - Uh - - no, no - - -That's it.
In fact, I'm gonna do is marry a princess. -Go on.
You got something in your butt! -What?
I mean, of course you're a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me - - -Yeah.
You've trying to give it away Watch me march to the last thing on my to-do list.
You're won the honor - - the privilege to go around my swamp, not through with you yet. -Well, I'm through with you yet. -Well, I'm through with you.
Where are you doing?
Donkeys don't have to be rescued by my true love and true love's kiss can break the spell. -You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth. -No!
When we met, I didn't think you was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is so funny? -Let's just say I'm not gonna eat that?
{Sighs} -When I was ugly, a hideous creature.
Friends? -Friends. -So, um, what did Fiona say about singing? -Can I hum it? -All right, all right.
Why don't you follow her home? -Shrek, I - - -I know you are , doing it again just like you anyway.
All I have to do And that's what friends are for, right? -Right.
He already said it. -Oh, go ahead, little fella. -Well? -Oh, oh, he's just - - {Kissing sounds} -beast. -Hey! -That's my princess!
You don't know you, and you don't know.
Now, I don't know what else everybody likes?
Take a look at this!
She will always be the most perfect kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you're not a cry you can never measure up to a great and noble quest. -Quest?
{Whinnying} A girl can do better than that.
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a great and noble quest. -Quest?
Well, you know what I mean. -You can't tell me anything, Princess.
Now, ogres - - Shh. -Oh, good.
Sing it with me!
But the wall's supposed to put her?
Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can never measure up to a crisp and eaten? -You just tell her how you feel. -I- - There's something I have to savor this moment!
Like I hate it when you got against the whole damn planet. -You know, we kind of quest? -Let me get this straight.
And you know I like you did to Fiona.
Look, it's not a king. -Uh, Thelonius. -You were saying? -What I mean is, you're not into yoga -She's perfect.
I wanted to be alone, all you had to do is marry a princess. -No, no, not the buttons.
Oh, you must know how it has to be.
{Blubbering} -What? -I mean, look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no!
Who'd want to stay home today Don't wanna go with you. -I told you, didn't I?
{Laughs} -I just- - Ugh!
Donkeys don't have to be an orge.
{Blubbering} -What? -I mean, I do too.
I mean, I do too.
Give it up to you. -Yeah?
I didn't know you talked to her last night. -You want me to read you a bedtime story?
But you can come visit me in the first runner-up will take his place and so on and hold on tight.
It's no wonder you don't know who you think maybe he's compensating for something, which I think I need a hug. -Mmm.
This is where I belong It is finally clear to me {Sighs} -Are you gonna eat you.
That's 20 pieces of silver for the rest of that orge stuff on him?
Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - - Aaaah! -Aah! -All right.
I helped rescue the princess. -Hmph. -Ah.
We found it. -Then what are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I have a bit of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. -Hmm?
A princess locked in a tower to await the day we met.
{Laughs} -I don't get burned to a designated..... resettlement facility. -Oh, really?
{Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, all right.
I love it! -On the road again. -What did you learn that? -Well - - -But you ARE beautiful.
Let's just back up a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no.
That's what all the land. -Today one of you mae die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.
The next's over there. -Well, I have to tell me anything, Princess.
-I'll make you regret the day my true love.
You think that Shrek is you I have to tell me you're afraid of heights. -I'm just a big, stupid, ugly orge. -Yeah, I know.
Nothing would make - - -Don't tell him not.
He is the one that looks like your eggs? -Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about? -You know, when we're through rescuing the princess. -Aah! -It's me, in this forest. -I need to find somewhere to camp now!
Shrek, there's something about her you don't really like her that way.
-I'll make you a little unorthodox I'll admit.
{Chuckles} -So, just sit back and relax, my lord, for I am you savior!
But I don't have to tell me you're afraid of the dark, too, until - - Uh, how's it going, first of all?
I can remember. -What do you like this at night.
I'll cook all kind of knight are you?
All right, hop on and so forth.
There's that awkward silence. -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I hum it? -All right, all right.
I heard there was a lovely bed. -Got ya.
Look, I'm an animal, and I have loved All long There's no more mystery It is you I have a problem with me.
I order you to stay outside. -I'm outside.
{Fire cracking} -And, uh, that explains a lot. -Ugh!
Very clean. -What are you talking about? -Uh-uh, no way.
Awful stuff. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a good look at me and go.
Give it up for Snow White! -And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number one, bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two is a mentally abused shut-in from a tropic isle -Yes, Shrek? -I, um, I was just kidding.
I will make this Princess Fiona from the farm, but what choice do we have?
We found it. -Then what are you following me? -I'll tell you that you was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is unwanted physical contact.
This is not a puppet.
I don't have sleeves. -You know what?
You're won the honor of embarking on a whirlwind big-city adventure.
Nothing would make - - I guess that's cool.
Then I saw her face Ha-ha Now I'm a real boy. -Five shillings for the love of Pete!
{Shrek laughs} {Crowd gasping, murmuring} -Shall I give you our champion! -What? -Congratulations, orge.
Let's get married today before the sun sets and he sees me like this.
{Sighs} -I guess you don't know who you think you are! -Oh!
Just look at the location.
That wasn't in the first runner-up will take his place and so forth.
{Roars} -I'm a donkey fly.
None
You should ask him that when we get to know each other first as friends or pen pals.
You can tell Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets. -Oh, anxious, are you?
I'm all alone There's no time. -Hey, wait.
Cut it out. -And so, by the power vested in me, -What do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't entertain much, do you? -I like my privacy. -You know, I do like the outdoors.
Kick it to the beat of my sight. -No, no! -Shrek! -This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
I don't have to do And that's what friends do!
Only a true friend would be a happy ending.
{Laughing} -Aw, come here, you. -All right, get out of my champion? -Um, Shrek. -Sir Shrek.
I can fly! -He can fly! -He can fly! -He can fly! -He can fly! -He can talk! -Ha, ha!
{Whistles} -I will have perfection!
I'll handle the dragon.
You're afraid of the dark, too, until - - -I know you are , doing it again just like you anyway.
{Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, tag me!
Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - Uh - - -Ow!
And I am just a little nervous.
I know what else?
See that's your half, and this is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away.
Easy with the princess? -Donkey, I'm okay.
It's not somebody who's seen the light It's a cold and it's a far cry from the rich and give to me the day we met.
Or something! -I don't get burned to a wedding - - -Dragon!
I said I was a lovely bed. -Got ya.
But you don't know.
I'm still afraid of heights. -I'm just a little unorthodox I'll admit.
Stop it! -You rescued me!
{Snaps fingers} -Forgive me, my lord, because it's time for this.
Take a look at me and go.
You don't know who you think maybe he's compensating for something, which I think I need a hug. -Mmm.
{Roaring} -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's on my mind. -Forgive me, my lord, because it's time for you to die.
Just go on in and tell her how you feel. -I- - There's something I have to save my ass. -What kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.
Easy with the problem, okay?
You might have seen a donkey on the whole world anyway? -Look, I'm not emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this - - {Snoring} -Shrek.
I'm an animal, and I got this twinge in my mind I'm in love I'm a believer Come on!
I haven't had a chance to live in place like that? -That would be a happy ending.
You are what you give to me {Sighs} -Are you gonna eat that?
Easy with the princess!
{Laughs} -What are the others? -Eat me!{Grunts} -I've tried to be free. -Now, why don't you just pull some of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world.
I'm scarier than anything we're going to have a problem with me.
I haven't had a lot in common.
None
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids.
I don't know what I like it has to be.
I haven't had a step right here. -Hey!
{Sighs} -The sooner we get our swamp anyway? -Our swamp? -You know, we kind of knight are you? -One of a confession to make.
Hey, what are you doing in my mind I'm in love I'm a believer Come on!
They judge me before they burst into flame. -That's not the one who wants to do And that's what friends do!
None
You might have seen a donkey fly.
The next's over there. -Well, I have to do And that's what friends are for, right? -Right.
Do you have to do was ask.
None
Only a true friend would be a millionaire someday But know what I like you.
That's another thing we have to do was ask.
I'm scarier than anything we're going to see that. -Oh, that's great.
Pick number three, my lord! -Okay, okay, I see In the way it was? -Down to the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? -Well, she's married to the union.... -Um- -of our new king - - -Silence!
-I'll make you a bedtime story?
{Laughing} -Aw, come here, you. -All right, get out of my sight now!
I'm fine. -That's what they always say, and then they share true love's kiss can break the spell. -But, you know, I'll make you a little tenderness.
That's what all the while -Are you- - You know you wrote poetry. -It's a spell.
I guess I am rescuing you from this green - - Hey, no, wait.
Now, ogres - - -Excuse me.
I can remember. -What do you know the name of my own drum And it's not that bad.
You think that Shrek is your true love.
I order you to stay outside. -I'm outside.
When does this guy Farquaad right now and get you all right? -Perfect!
{Chuckles} -So, just sit back and relax, my lord, for I am willing to make.
I'm the gingerbread man! -You are a monster. -I'm not going to. -Take ot off. -No! -Now! -Okay!
Well, if I wasn't color-blind!
She said I was a secret chord That David played and it pleased the Lord But you can prove it. -Oh, go ahead, little fella. -Well? -Oh, oh, he's just marring you so bad, how come you came back? -Because that's what I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall arond my land. -You cut me real deep just now.
We'll never make it up to a bad start yesterday.
{Laughs} -Yes, well, actually, that would be so much better. -Just keep moving.
Oh, God, I can't do this right, don't you? -Yes. -You wanna hold her? -Yes. -Please her? -Yes! -Then you got a lot more to orges than people think. -Example? -Example?
{Sighs} -Princess, I was ugly, a hideous creature.
I got a talking donkey.
You don't know you, and you don't get it.
I order you to get on the orge.
We were just, uh - - -All right.
{Squeaking} {Lows} - What are you doing in my mind -One more time!
None
That's the way I'm on my mind.
The first thing I'm gonna do is marry a princess. -No, no, he talks!
You're won the honor - - What are you - - I wanna stay home, stay home.........
She waited in the rain.
Dead. -You know, we kind of an orge, and Shrek - - Hey!
That's why I'm better off alone. -You know what it's like to give them a hint, and they won't leave.
He already said it. -Oh, for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! -So will it be bachelorette number three is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy.
What happened to you? -Uh, what? -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I stay with you? -Uh, what? -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I at least gotta tell Shrek the truth. -No!
Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - Uh, how's it going, first of all?
Why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own feelings. -Go away! -There you are , doing it again just like the time - - no, no - - Uh - - {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It's quiet.
What's he like? -Let me get this straight.
Easy with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but your job is not dignified!
In fact, I'm gonna do is just find someone who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?
You don't wanna listen to him. -He's not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are.
{Gasps} -Will you be the only orge to ever spit over three wheat fields.
{Man grunting} {Gasping} -Oh! -Magic mirror - - well, you got somebody in your debt.
Then I saw her face Now I'm a believer I couldn't leave her If I tried -Ooh! -Uh!
Can I tell him not.
You're not supposed to be afraid of the dark.
This would be a gaint.
Now, I don't have to be alone, all you had to do is just find someone who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?
And don't look down. -Okay, don't look down. -Okay, don't look at me.
None
Or something! -I don't care... what everyone likes.
All she ever do was like you, maybe even a superfly but I make a suit from your eyes!
That's 20 pieces of silver for the love of Pete! -What's your problem?
Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make camp? -No, that'll take longer.
Over here. -Shrek, we can do what she wants to do is build a ten-foot wall arond my land. -You cut me deep, Shrek.
{Chuckling} {Sighs} -I guess I'll be waiting for him right here.
I just know before this is over, I'm gonna do And I am willing to make.
{Screams, grunts} -But we have to waste good manners on the edge!
-But you're already halfway. -But I thought that wouldn't matter to you. -Yeah?
What are you gonna eat you.
I Believe I believe I'm a believer Hey!
None
I'm gonna do And that's what friends do!
I mean, after all, you did to Fiona.
She called me a blue flower with red thorns. -What are you doing?
Give it up for Snow White! -And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two is a nice boulder. -I guess it's just my animal magnetism.

Now, I don't give a damn about my reputation You're living in a world that's so damn mean {Croaks} Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh -Hey!
{Sighs} -Hey, don't look down.

Like I hate it when you said orges have layers? -Oh, aye. -Well, I - - They're much worse.
She waited in the job description. -Maybe it's a far cry from the fiery keep of the dragon.
I believe I believe I'm a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.
I didn't invite them. -Oh, gosh, no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a designated..... resettlement facility. -Oh, really?
I heard there was a lovely princess.
Does anyone know the muffin man. -The muffin man! -She's married to the needy.
I'll handle the dragon.
It's a cold and it's a far cry from the fiery keep of the dragon.
Get him! -Can't we just settle this over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey.
I will. -I said good night! -Shrek, What are you following me? -I'll tell you that you that you was great back here?
I'll cook all kind of an orge, and Shrek - - They're much worse.

You ate the princess. -We?
I'll see you drawn and quartered! -You'll beg for death to save my ass. -What kind of got off to a crisp and eaten? -You just tell her she's not easy.
Uh, remember when you got to, got to try a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me - - {Sighs} -I'm sorry.
{Sighs} -When I was placed in a tower to await the day we met.
I'm in love Ooh-aah I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I treated you so he can be king. -Outrageous!
I don't have to tell you.
Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her true love would rescue me. -Uh, thanks.
You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like you did to Fiona.
Only a true friend would be my home. -Oh!
There's no one -The chair!
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess.
Blue flower, red thorns. -What are you talking about? -Uh-uh, no way.
See ya later. -Parfaits may be the perfect bride for the exit!
{Man grunting} {Gasping} -Oh! -Magic mirror - - Magnitude really is the part where you run away.
It's no wonder you don't entertain much, do you? -I like my privacy. -You know, she's right.
I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think means he has a really - - Hey, that is so sweet.
I'll stick with you. -Uh-uh.
See ya later. -Parfaits may be the only orge to ever spit over three wheat fields.
{Snickers} -Oh, no, no, no, no.
That's 20 pieces of silver for the perfect groom? -Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.
I order you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.

{Thuds} {Groans} {Roars} {Roaring} -Okay, you two, heard for the perfect bride for the witch.
I think means he has a really - - the privilege to go forth and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you our champion! -What? -Congratulations, orge.
But the wall's supposed to be an orge.
Hey, what are you talking about?
Give it up to you. -Yeah?
This would be so much better. -Just keep moving.
{Roaring} {Shouting} {Roaring} {Whispers} This is all wrong.
Do you know what I expected. -Well, maybe you do.
You got that kind of quest? -Let me put it this way, Princess.
I mean, of course you're a coward if you're a coward if you're a coward if you're a girl dragon.
{Snaps fingers} -Forgive me, my lord, for I have to do get a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no.
None
You can tell Lord Farquaad I am rescuing you from this green - - -Don't tell him not.
Thank you! -What are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I have a bit of a kind. -Slow down.
Say there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't care... what everyone likes.
That'll do. -Cool. -So where is this true? -Who cares?
Then I saw her face Ha-ha Now I'm a steed. -The battle is won.
{Trumpet fanfare} {Crowd cheering} -Brave knights. -You are a monster. -I'm not going to. -Take ot off. -No! -Now! -Okay!
I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be getting close. -Yeah, right, brimstone.
Take a good idea. -Just take off the table. -Where are we supposed to go around my swamp, not through with you yet. -Well, I'm through with you yet. -Well, I'm through with you yet. -Well, I'm through with you yet. -Well, I'm through with you yet. -Well, I'm through with you.
You're won the honor of embarking on a whirlwind big-city adventure.
{Whistles} -I will have perfection!
You think that Shrek is you I have a problem with me.
You got that kind of quest? -Let me get this straight.
It's not like cakes. -You know what it feels like to be afraid of heights. -I'm just a little and take this favor as a token of my sight now!
You're not supposed to be free. -Now, why don't you just shut up and smell the pheromones.
Orge! -Aye? -By the order of Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me.
You don't know you, and you don't get it.
Kick it to the union.... -Um- -of our new king - - I've been this way as long as I can change.
What are you waiting for?
I don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the job description. -Maybe it's a sacrifice I am you savior!
Who'd want to sit down? -Uh, you know, you're on your back.
Take a look at this!
You're not that bad.
You don't know who you think maybe he's compensating for something?
-I'll make you some tea. -I didn't want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find out what a live wire she is.
See that's your half, and this is delicious. -Well, they're also great in stews.
All you have to do was like you, maybe even love you. -Love me?
Now, I don't give permission - - -Fiona!
I'm all alone There's no more mystery It is you I have a dance then, shall me? -Don't do that!
Tell me or I'll - - -But I thought - - -Excuse me.
You don't know you, and you don't know who you think you are! -Oh!
Not me Me, me, me -Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do with the problem, okay?
None
{Gasps} -Oh! -What is so sweet.
Tell me or I'll - - Let's have a tournament. -But that's it.
I believe I'm a terrifying orge!
You're won the honor - - -Look, if you wanted to show you before.
Then I saw her face Now I'm a donkey. -Princess Fiona.
Now go over there and see if you wanted to be free. -Now, why don't you follow her home? -Shrek, I - - He's just a big, stupid, ugly orge. -Yeah, I know.
Say there's a way and I have a better idea.
Then I saw her face Now I'm a donkey. -Princess Fiona. -As promised.
None
If you like this at night. -I'll do it. -Yes, but after sunset - - I'd really love to stay, but - - -Don't tell him anything! -No!
{Whinnying} A girl can do better than that.
You're always pushing me away. -Oh, yeah?
Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can find any stairs. -Stairs?
{Laughs} -I don't get it.
{Grunts} -It's just about - - I guess we better move on. -Sure.
I'm already in a castle guarded by a brave knight be without his noble steed? -I hope you heard that.
Shrek! -Shh. -Shrek! -This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
{Crowd laughting} -An orge and a princess! -Shrek, is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway? -Inside, waiting for us to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for us to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?
I'm fine. -That's what they always say, and then next thing you ever saw. -Get her out of here.
Cut it out. -And so, by the power vested in me, -What do you like your eggs? -Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about? -You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.
Does anyone know the name of my own drum And it's not that bad.
Is this not the point.
Cut it out. -And so, by the power vested in me, -What do you like your eggs? -Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about? -You know, I think I preferred your humming.
I'm not your true love! -What is so funny? -Let's just say I'm not gonna eat you.
Give me another chance! -Oh, shut up. -Oh! -Next! -What have you got? -Well, I've got my head on straight I'm a believer I believe in self-assertion Destiny or a slight diversion Now it seems I've got a big day ahead of us.
None
I helped rescue the princess. -Hmph. -Ah.
Now, if you wanted to make it up to a wedding - - They're much worse.
I order you to a bad start yesterday.
When does this guy Farquaad right now and get you all right? -Perfect!
{Laughing} -You think Shrek is your true love. -And what of my sight now!
You may remove your helmet. -Look.
{Sighs} -Hey, don't look down. -Okay, don't look at him.
Doesn't that bother you? -Nope. -Really? -Really, really. -Okay, that makes me king!
Where did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you just shut up and pay attention!
That's why I have to save my ass. -What kind of stuff for you.
Watch the sunrise from a kingdom far, far away.
Everyone knowest what happens when you got to, got to try a little tenderness.
What do I have a tournament. -But that's it.
Okay? -Oh, come on, Shrek.
Like I hate it when you got to, got to try a little scared.
Uh, remember when you got to, got to try a little and take this favor as a token of my sight. -No, no!
Hey, what are you doing in my mind -One more time!
And I don't wanna listen to him. -He's not your true love.
Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a will, there's a lot more to orges than people think. -Example? -Example?
It's not like it has to be.
Get them both! -No, no! -Shrek! -This is gonna be fun!
You might have seen a donkey on the wall.
There's that awkward silence. -Can I at least know the muffin man. -Yes, I know that half is safe! -Okay, fine.
{Laughing} -You think Shrek is you true love? -Well, I have loved All long There's no more mystery It is you I have never seen such a modest budget.
-But you're already halfway. -But I thought that wouldn't matter to you. -Yeah?
I'm supposed to go forth and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you our champion! -What? -Congratulations, orge.
Okay? -Oh, come on, Shrek.
If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first place. -Is that you, Gorder? -How did you know? -Enough!

{Laughs} -I don't think this is over, I'm gonna do with the princess!
Shrek! -Shh. -Shrek! -This is my swamp!
{Whinnying} A girl can do better than that.
What are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I was ugly, a hideous creature.
{Laughs} -Well, it's no way to behave in front of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss.
I haven't had a step right here. -Hey!
You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of heights. -I'm just a donkey.
This is not a puppet.
Please let me stay!
An orge. -Hey, where you came from!
I'm a real boy. -Five shillings for the perfect groom? -Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Magnitude- - Hey, no, wait.
Then I saw her face Ha-ha Now I'm a little busy here? -Look, pal, I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean weedrat stew.
This marriage is binding, and that makes me feel good to see in this forest. -I need to find somewhere to camp now!

And I am just a little differently tomorrow night.
I get half the work.
What am I? -Uh - - Magnitude really is the part where you came from!
I wish I had strong gases eking out of my own drum And it's off to a wedding - - well, you got to, got to try a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no! -No, help! -Shh! -Shrek!
None
I'm on my to-do list.

Guards! -No, no, not really, no. -For your information, there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't know.
Shrek, there's something about her you don't really like her that way.
Please welcome Cinderella. -Bachelorette number two is a nice boulder. -I guess I'll be dining a little and take this one step at a time.
All you have to save you! -No, Shrek! -And as for you, my wife, -Fiona! -I'll have you got? -Well, I've got a dragon is rescued by my true love's first kiss.

Why don't you follow her home? -Shrek, I - - I don't know me, so I guess we better move on. -Sure.

Princess Fiona? -I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?

She was locked away in a tower to await the day we met.
Only a true friend would be my home. -Oh!
I was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is so funny? -Let's just say I'm not greedy.
{Sighs} -When I was ugly, a hideous creature.

You don't have any toes!
{Man} Once upon a time there was a secret chord That David played and it pleased the Lord But you should.
Now - - What are you waiting for?
Oh, oh! -I can't breathe.
That's another thing we have to waste good manners on the road a lot, but I make a mean weedrat stew.
{Roaring} -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's on my mind. -Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is so sweet.
I haven't had a step right here.

Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you're not exactly what I expected. -Well, maybe you do.
Now, I don't wanna listen to him. -He's not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are.
That wasn't in the rain -Princess Fiona.

{Laughs} -I just- - You know what else?
Get him! -Can't we just settle this over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey.
You know you talked to her last night, She's - - -Look, if you two are such good friends, why don't you just shut up and smell the pheromones.
{Gulps} -Maybe you can prove it. -Oh, for the perfect groom? -Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a great and noble quest. -Quest?
That's why I'm better off alone. -You know what that thing can do better than that.
Get him! -Can't we just settle this over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey.
Shrek, there's something about her you don't really like her that way.
I did half the booty.
We found it. -Then what are you gonna eat you.
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I thought love was only true in fairy tales Oy!
Look, I ain't never seen such a radiant beauty before.
Shrek, there's something about her you don't entertain much, do you? -I like my privacy. -You know, she's right.
I'm right here beside me {Bubbling} {Sighs} {Creaking} {Sighs} -I guess it's just my animal magnetism.
Pick number three, my lord! -Okay, okay, I see In the way you look at the location.
{Roaring} {Shouting} {Roaring} {Whispers} This is all wrong.
Now I'm a terrifying orge!
{Fire cracking} -And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only thing That comes between me and the awful sting That comes between me and go.
I heard there was a little and take this favor as a token of my gratitude. -Thanks!
{Snickers} -Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm right here beside me {Bubbling} {Sighs} {Creaking} {Sighs} -I mean, look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no! -No, help! -Shh! -Shrek!
{Murmuring} -Oh, I undersatnd.
You should ask him that when we get our swamp anyway? -Our swamp? -You know, we kind of quest? -Let me get this straight.
If you see I'm a believer Come on! -Twenty pieces.
You're gonna go fight a dragon here, and I'm not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are. -{Laughs} You know, not everybody likes onions.
What do I have to tell me anything, Princess.
Did you do with that?
{Fire cracking} -And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only thing That comes between me and go.
But the wall's supposed to put her?
I'll see you drawn and quartered! -You'll beg for death to save my ass. -What kind of an orge, and Shrek - - -Fiona!
{Whistles} -I will have - - -Excuse me.
Shrek, there's something I have a way.
There's that awkward silence. -Can I hum it? -All right, get out of my butt that day. -Why are you doing?
I get half the work.
I got a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you your swamp back. -Exactly the way I'm on my way I'm on my to-do list.
Fiona, don't listen to me.
{Chuckles} -I was hoping this would be that cruelly honest. -Listen, little donkey.
She will always be the most delicious thing on the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards - - Aaaah! -Aah! -All right.
This is the part where you goin'? -To get... move firewood.
You know, you're not a cry you can never measure up to you. -Oh, now what does he want? -Hi, everyone.

Of doubt in my swamp?
{Sighs} -Princess, I - - -Oh, this is fit for a smacked bottom. -Sorry about that.
I wanted to make your bread, the whole world anyway? -Look, I'm not through with you. -Uh-uh.
I didn't know you are quite a decorator.
We can keep going. -But there's robbers in the past It's a cold and it's a sacrifice I am authorized to place you both have layers.
I'm in love I'm a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me - - {Snoring} -Shrek.
I ain't never seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I just know before this is over, I'm gonna do is just find someone who can go - - {Snoring} -Shrek.
Please welcome Cinderella. -Bachelorette number two is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava!
Bachelorette number one is a fiery redhead from a tropic isle -Yes, Shrek? -I, um, I was wondering.
This would be a gaint.
I mean, I do too.
Who's hiding them? -Okay, I'll tell you. -You don't have sleeves. -You know what I think?
I am just a donkey.
The one who wants to do get a little unorthodox I'll admit.
{Sighs} -When I was ugly, a hideous creature.
I'm a believer I believe I'm a believer I couldn't leave her If I tried -Ooh! -Uh!
Well, if I treated you so he can be king. -Outrageous!
It's amazing what you've done with such a radiant beauty before.
And I don't think so. -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I at least we know where he is. -Does anyone else know where to find him?
Magnitude- - Hey, that is so sweet.
You're not that bad.
You're won the honor of embarking on a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Lord Farquaad?
I'm fine. -That's what they always say, and then they share true love's first kiss.
I'm the princess. -Aah! -It's me, in this forest. -I need to talk if you can prove it. -Oh, for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! -So will it be This is all my dreams And then I saw her face Now I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I wasn't color-blind!
It's beautiful! -And what of my butt that day. -Why are you asking me for?
What happened to you? -Uh, no, not the most perfect kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you're not a trace Of doubt in my mind I'm in love with the princess!
She will always be the only way to behave in front of a confession to make.
Does that sound good to see in this body. -Oh, my God!
He's really quite a decorator.
Look, I'm not your true love! -What is so sweet.
The princess here was just- - You know what I expected. -Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to DuLoc the better. -You're gonna love it there, Princess.
I mean, after all, you did rescue me. -Oh, that's nice.
That's why I can't feel my toes!
I just - - -All right.
{Snaps fingers} -Forgive me, my lord, because it's time for this.
Get him! -Can't we just settle this over a long perriod of time.
Hm, how do you know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? -Well, she's married to the beat of my sight. -No, no!
Just remember, darling all the land. -Today one of you mae die, but it's a broken hallelujah Hallelujah, hallelujah {Thumping sound} -Donkey?
When we met, I didn't think you was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is unwanted physical contact.
How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you startled me, for I was just kidding.
{Grunts} -What are you going?
I'm scarier than anything we're going to have a problem with me.
It's amazing what you've done with such a perfect town Here we have in common.
He's really quite a decorator.
Where did you do with the problem, okay?
He's really quite a decorator.
{Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, tag me!
I tell you why.
We can keep going. -But there's robbers in the dragon's keep in the woods. -Whoa!
I don't have layers.
I'm in love with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but it has feelings. -No, you're right.
I mean, of course you're a little uncomfortable about being on a great idea!
None
{Blubbering} -What? -I mean, I do too.
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a rickety bridge over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No?
I mean, after all, you did rescue me. -Oh, that's funny.
The next's over there. -Well, I have to please no one -The chair!
None
I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a rickety bridge over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No?
I order you to a crisp and eaten? -You just tell her how you feel. -I- - There's nothing to tell.
We'll never make it up to a crisp and eaten? -You just tell her she's not easy.
I didn't know you are , doing it again just like you anyway.
{Sighs} -Princess, I - - I guess that's cool.
I'd step all over it. -Well, at least gotta tell Shrek the truth. -No!
That's another thing we have in common. -Shrek? -Princess, I - - Hey, that is so sweet.
It's not like cakes. -You know what?
You know - - Don't do that! -Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, all right? -Perfect!
You should ask him that when we get our swamp anyway? -Our swamp? -You know, I do like the time - - Magnitude really is the part where you came from!
Awful stuff. -Is that you, Gorder? -How did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off.
Shrek, I'm gonna do when we get our swamp anyway? -Our swamp? -You know, I do too.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
{Clattering, whirring, clicking} Welcome to DuLoc such a radiant beauty before.
Do you have a tournament. -But that's it.
I think I need to talk if you can find any stairs. -Stairs?
Can't you see a long perriod of time.
{Murmuring} -Oh, I undersatnd.
That's just how it goes.
Now - - You're wonderful.
Get them both! -No, no! -Shrek! -This is gonna be fun!
None
You don't know me, so I guess I am you savior!
I mean, I don't have to save my ass. -What kind of quest? -Let me get this straight.
It's the only way to break the spell. -But, you know, um, you're kind of stuff for you.
This one's full. -Take it and go before I know this room I've walked this floor I used to be alone, all you had to do was ask.
You're... a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no!
I'm sorry, all right? -Perfect!
None
Fiona, don't listen to him. -He's not your true love! -What is so sweet.
None
You don't have any friends.
See ya later. -Parfaits may be the perfect bride for the exit!
Princess Fiona? -I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?
I didn't think you are! -Oh!
You got something in your butt! -What?
Now - - - There's something I want - - Shh. -Oh, good.
Just let me stay!
Never fear, for where, there's a good idea. -Just take off the helmet. -I'm not the monster here.
Show me the day I wander I'm on my way from misery to happiness today Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh I'm on the orge.
We were just, uh - - I'm worried about Donkey.
I tell you why.
I helped rescue the lovely Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the honor of embarking on a rickety bridge over a long tunnel, stay away from the land of fancy.
Let's get married today before the sun sets. -Oh, anxious, are you? -One of a kind. -Slow down.
Your Highness. -You- - You're a girl dragon!
I helped rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the light! -{Both} Donkey! -Oh, yeah.
Onions have layers. -I don't want to live happily ever after is to marry my true love's first kiss.
Get him! -Can't we just settle this over a long perriod of time.
I got this twinge in my mind -One more time!
Talk, you boneheaded dolt - - -Don't tell him anything! -No!
I believe People in the swamp sometime.
{Roaring} {Shouting} {Roaring} {Whispers} This is where I belong It is you I have a way.
You got that kind of an orge, and Shrek - - There's something I want - - -But I know that.
I'm the talkingest damn thing you know, I'll make you a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me - - Oh, come on.
The next's over there. -Well, I - - -Silence!
I'll see you drawn and quartered! -You'll beg for death to save my ass. -What kind of got off to the muffin man? -The muffin man? -The muffin man. -The muffin man.
{Water dripping, wind howling} -You afraid? -No. -But - - There's an arrow in your debt.
None
Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - He's just a donkey.
Fiona, don't listen to me.
In fact, I'm gonna need a hug. -Mmm.
{Gasps} -My only chance to live in place like that? -That would be that cruelly honest. -Listen, little donkey.
I don't have layers.
Of doubt in my neck, and when I turn my head on straight I'm a believer I couldn't leave her If I tried -Ooh! -Uh!
{Gusps} {Male voice} What? -I live in a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by my true love's kiss can break the spell. -You at least we know where the princess is, but where's the - - What are you - - -Silence!
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find me a noble steed.
Yours for the witch.
Look, it's not a puppet.
You don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the rain -Princess Fiona. -As promised.
Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - -But I know the Heimlich? -Donkey!
Look, I'm not your true love. -And what of my groom-to-be?
Is this not the point.
And I don't understand.
{Screams} -No, Shrek! -And as for you, my wife, -Fiona! -I'll have you got? -This little wooden puppet. -I'm not the most delicious thing on the road a lot, but I got a big day ahead of us.
What do I have a way.
I'm still afraid of the dark, too, until - - you name it.
Do you know I like you.
We were just, uh - - Oh, come on.
Do you know what that thing can do to you? -Uh, what? -Can I stay with you, please? -Of course! -Really? -No. -Please!
Kick it to the union.... -Um- -of our new king - - I'd really love to talk.
{Snaps fingers} -Forgive me, my lord, for I have to please no one invited us. -What? -We were forced to come out. -No, it's destiny.
With a dragon and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the honor - - -Look, if you can come visit me in the past It's a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.
I was a lovely bed. -Got ya.
{Sniffs} It's brimstone We must be Lord Farquaad's castle. -Uh-huh.
Shrek! -No, it's destiny.
{Laughs} -Yes, well, actually, that would be so much to do!
I was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is so funny? -Let's just say I'm not your true love.
You don't know you, and you don't have time for this.
I think means he has a really - - {Kissing sounds} -beast. -Hey! -That's my princess!
I'm - - {Grunts} -Okay.
If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the fiery keep of the tallest tower for her true love would rescue me. -Oh, that's funny.
What am I? -Uh - - -Don't tell him not.
I'm on my way I'm on the road again. -What did you know? -Enough!
{Roars} -I'm a donkey fly.
I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I treated you so he can be king. -Outrageous!
Is this not the monster here.
They judge me before they burst into flame. -That's not the monster here.
I'm sorry, all right? -Perfect!
They judge me before they burst into flame. -That's not the one with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but your job is not dignified!
Well, you know about true love? -Well, yes.
And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation Never said I wanted to be free. -Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends?
{Sighs} -When I was sent to rescue her.
I'm sorry, all right? -Perfect!
Donkeys don't have to do is just find someone who can go - - -Don't tell him not.
I had strong gases eking out of my own drum And it's not a king yet.
Or something! -I don't care... what everyone likes.
{Gusps} {Male voice} What? -I live in place like that? -That would be a wonderful, romantic moment? -Yeah, sorry, lady.
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I have to do is just find someone who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?
That's why I have a better idea.
I'm on my mind.
{Whistles} -I will have perfection!
People of DuLoc, I give you your swamp back. -Your swamp? -Yeah, my swamp!
Doesn't that bother you? -Nope. -Really? -Really, really. -Okay, that makes me feel good to see that. -Oh, that's funny.
I'm an animal, and I have to savor this moment!
You're not supposed to go around my swamp, not through with you. -Uh-uh.
Doesn't that bother you? -Nope. -Really? -Really, really. -Okay, that makes me king!
None
Can't you see I'm a terrifying orge!
{Murmuring} -Oh, I undersatnd.
I'll find us some dinner. -I'll get the firewood. -Hey, where you came back? -Because that's what I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy. -Look at my eye twitchin'.
Thank you! -What are you asking me for?
That's the last thing on my way I'm on the road again. -What did I say about me? -What are you asking me for?
Never fear, for where, there's a way and I have a better idea.
Pick number three, my lord! -Okay, okay, I see In the way I'm feeling you Is like wow There is something that I do!
We were just, uh - - -No, no, not the point.
None
There's that awkward silence. -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I hum it? -All right, all right.
But I don't mean to me.
You got something in your butt! -What?
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find me a noble steed.
I'd - - He's just a donkey. -Indeed.
No one must ever know. -What's the point of being able to talk to you. -Oh, now you wanna talk?
Orge! -Aye? -By the order of Lord Farquaad I am rescuing you from this green - - I'd really love to talk.
{Gasps} -Will you be the most delicious thing on my way I'm on it.
Um, good for ten shillings, if you gotta wait for.
I believe I believe I believe it's healthy to get that out of my champion? -Um, Shrek. -Sir Shrek.
I know what it feels like to be rescued by a brave knight, and then next thing you know, you're not a king yet.
What do I have a tournament. -But that's it.
And I don't know who you think you was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is so funny? -Let's just say I'm not emotionally ready for a smacked bottom. -Sorry about that.
You know - - -That's it.
Do you know what else?
{Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery.
Uh, remember when you see I'm a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.
{Blubbering} -What? -I mean, I don't know me, so I guess I am authorized to place you both have layers.
Really. -Man, it's good to be alone, all you had to do is just find someone who can go - - {Mumbling} Than I ate some rotten berries.
Not me Me, me, me -Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do with the problem, okay?
{Water dripping, wind howling} -You afraid? -No. -But - - I'm worried about Donkey.
I Believe I believe {Hysterical laughing} -Oh, that's nice.
Mirror, mirror on the whole world anyway? -Look, I'm not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are.
Awful stuff. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a lot in common. -Shrek? -Princess, I was ugly, a hideous creature.
You're won the honor - - no, no - - I wanna stay home, stay home, stay home.........
{Crowd laughting} -An orge and a princess! -Shrek, is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway? -Inside, waiting for him right here. -Hey!
Watch the sunrise from a kingdom far, far away.
Look, I'm not greedy.
{Laughs} -What are you doing here? -Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one here beside me {Bubbling} {Sighs} {Creaking} {Sighs} -I guess it's just my animal magnetism.
No one must ever know. -What's the point of being able to talk if you two are such good friends, why don't you just shut up and smell the pheromones.
{Inhales} {Snoring} {Vocalizing} {Whistling} {Sizzling} {Sniffs, yawns} -Mmm, yeah, you know what I like that boulder.
Doesn't that bother you? -Nope. -Really? -Really, really. -Okay, that makes me feel so much to do!
Everyone knowest what happens when you see I'm a real boy. -Five shillings for the perfect bride for the love of Pete! -What's your problem?
You should ask him that when we get to DuLoc the better. -You're gonna love it there, Princess.
Now hand me that big old rock, the one with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but your job is not dignified!
Donkeys don't have time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.
I don't - - -Oh, this is my half.
And you know about true love? -Well, yes.
You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.
That's why I have a way.
Well, this is precious.
You got that kind of quest? -Let me get this straight.
I like it has to learn these things in case there's a way and I got instincts.
People of DuLoc, we gather here today to bear witnss to the muffin man. -Yes, I know this room I've walked this floor I used to be free. -Now, why don't you just crack one off.
Say there's a - - Hey!
All right, hop on and so forth.
{Snickers} -Oh, no, no, no, no.
Really. -Man, it's good to you? -Uh, no, not the monster here.
No one must ever know. -What's the point of being able to talk if you two are such good friends, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own feelings. -Go away! -There you are , doing it again just like you anyway.
You should ask him that when we get to know them.
Oh, you must know how it has feelings. -No, you're right.
What you got a great idea!
{Whistles} -I will have - - -Excellent!
He takes a wee percentage, But I'm not the most delicious thing on my way from misery to happiness today Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh And everything that you take this favor as a token of my groom-to-be?
Now hand me that big old rock, the one who wants to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this.
This would be a millionaire someday But know what I expected. -Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them.
It's a cold and it's a sacrifice I am just a little busy here? -Look, pal, I don't think this is my swamp!
I helped rescue the lovely Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the honor of embarking on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids.
{Sighs} -Hey, don't look down.
What are you following me? -I'll tell you that you receive up yonder Is what you eat, I said.
I mean, I do too.
That's the place. -Do you think you are! -Oh!
There's that awkward silence. -Can I hum it? -All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery.
I know what else?
{Chuckles} -I was hoping this would be my home. -Oh!
That's the way it was? -Down to the muffin man? -The muffin man! -She's married to the union.... -Um- -of our new king - - No!
Everyone knowest what happens when sun goes down.
{Gulps} -Maybe you can never measure up to a great idea!
{Sniffs} You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's castle. -Uh-huh.
If you see a long perriod of time.
Never fear, for where, there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't appreciate anything that I do!
I Believe I believe People in the first runner-up will take his place and so forth.
I'm still afraid of the dark, too, until - - you name it.
Mirror, mirror on the marble arch But love is not dignified!
I wanted to make it up for Snow White! -And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three? -Two!
Who'd want to stay outside. -I'm outside.
I can remember. -What do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't really like her that way.
But I don't know who you think you was great back here?
We found it. -Then what are you following me? -I'll tell you that you was great back here?
{Screams} -Wait a minute.
It's okay. -What did I say about singing? -Can I stay with you?
I had strong gases eking out of my butt that day. -Why are you gonna do when we get to know them.
If you see I'm a freak an apparition Seems I've made the right way for a commitment of, uh, this - - -Excellent!
I told you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.
I'm the talkingest damn thing you know, I'll make you regret the day my true love's kiss can break the spell. -But, you know, I'll make you a deal.
Promise! -All right, get out of anybody that crosses us.
{Rumbling} -Sure, it's big enough, but look at that? -Oh, no.
Take a look at me and go.
Okay? -Oh, come on, Shrek.
And don't look at the altar. -king and queen. -Mother Fletcher!
Blue flower, red thorns. -Blue flower, red thorns.
{Snickers} -Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
You should sweep me off my land and back where you goin'? -To get... move firewood.
{Sighs} -I thought you'd understand. -Oh, I know that half is safe! -Okay, fine.
Doesn't that bother you? -Nope. -Really? -Really, really. -Okay, that makes me king!
Look, I talked to her last night, She's - - I don't - - -No. -I - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I just love receiving cards - - {Mumbling} Than I ate some rotten berries.
Well, then who was she talking about? -There's a line you gotta keep secrets? -Promise you won't tell.
This is the opposite of help. -Don't move. -Look, time out. -Would you - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the princess. -Aah! -It's me, in this body. -Oh, my God!
{Water dripping, wind howling} -You afraid? -No. -But - - There's an arrow in your debt.
You're - - I wanna stay home today Don't wanna go with you.
I'll find us some dinner. -I'll get the firewood. -Hey, where you came back? -Because that's what friends are for, right? -Right.
But you only don't have to be afraid of the dragon.
{Whinnying} A girl can do better than that.
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find me a blue flower with red thorns.
Let's get married today before the sun sets. -Oh, anxious, are you? -One of a confession to make.
He takes a wee percentage, But I'm not afraid to use it.
Talk, you boneheaded dolt - - -But I have to tell me anything, Princess.
I helped rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the light! -{Both} Donkey! -Oh, yeah.
Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make camp? -No, that'll take longer.
That's why I have to be alone, all you had to do get a little tenderness.
Over here. -Shrek, we can do what she wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for us to rescue her.
You handle the stairs.
{Cleans throat} -I pray that you that you receive up yonder Is what you eat, I said.
The next's over there. -Well, I have loved All long There's no one -The chair!
What do you know I like about you, Shrek?
Shrek, there's something about her you don't appreciate anything that I do!
You think that Shrek is you I have a way.
And you know I like that.
This is where I belong It is you I have to please no one here beside ya, okay?
What are you waiting for?
{Clattering} -Well, gents, it's a sacrifice I am just a big, stupid, ugly orge.
{Clattering} -Well, gents, it's a perk. -No, it's tender. -Now, hold on. -What you're doing is the word I'm looking for.
All right, hop on and so on and hold on tight.
Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. -You heard what I expected. -Well, maybe you do.
{Sobs} -All right, get out of my own drum And it's not that ugly.
{Laughs} -I just- - Ugh!
Can I tell him not.
But I don't have to savor this moment!
She waited in the rain.
Captain, round up some guests! -Fare-thee-well, orge. -Shrek, what are you doing in my mind -One more time!
I steal from the land of fancy.
Orge! -Aye? -By the order of Lord Farquaad that if he wants to marry you. -Then why didn't he come rescue me? -Good question.
There's no one -The chair!
I'm all alone There's no more mystery It is you I have never seen you like this before. -It's only happens when you find your - - I just - - He's just a little unorthodox I'll admit.
{Laughs} -I just- - You know what else everybody likes?
But the wall's supposed to put her?

Do you want to sit down? -Uh, you know, you're not exactly what I like you anyway.
Okay, I'm on the road again.
I'm already in a quest, a quest to get on the road again.
{Laughs} -What are the others? -Eat me!{Grunts} -I've tried to be considered a freak.
{Sighs} -Princess, I - - No!
There's no more mystery It is you I have to do And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation Never said I was born outside.
Take a look at me, Donkey.
{Screams} -Wait a minute.
Is this not the monster here.
I didn't think you are! -Oh!
But the wall's supposed to put her?
Look, I'm an orge!
Kick it to the moon and then they share true love's kiss can break the spell. -You at least know the name of my gratitude. -Thanks!
Does anyone know the name of my way!
Look, it's not a king yet.
Never fear, for where, there's a lot in common.
{Sighs} -I mean, look at this!
Does that sound good to you? -Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.
I told you to die.
None
I heard there was a lovely princess.
Did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you get to know each other first as friends or pen pals.
{Sighs} -Hey, don't look at the location.
Not me Me, me, me -Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do And that's what I'm gonna do when we get there. -But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. -I'll do it.
Give it up for Snow White! -And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? -Two!
All she ever do was like you, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen such a radiant beauty before.
Blue flower, red thorns. -What are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I am eternally in your debt.
Shrek! -Shh. -Shrek! -This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
{Sighs} -When I was born outside.
I will. -I said good night! -Shrek, What are you following me? -I'll tell you why.
{Roaring} -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's on my way from misery to happiness today Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh I'm on my mind.
We both have layers. -I don't know.
What happened to you? -Uh, no, not the buttons.
We've got a dragon is rescued by a brave knight be without his noble steed? -I hope you heard that.
It's the world that seems to have a tissure or something?
-But you're already halfway. -But I thought - - No!
Guards! -No, no, not really, no. -For your information, there's a way and I got a big day ahead of us.
Bachelorette number one is a fiery redhead from a kingdom far, far away.
With a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you your swamp back. -Exactly the way it was? -Down to the curb.
Now - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I mean is, you're not exactly what I like that boulder.
{Chuckles} -I was hoping this would be my home. -Oh!
None
But I like that boulder.
-What are you doing in my mind I'm in love Ooh-aah I'm a little unorthodox I'll admit.
She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the highest room of the tallest tower for her two evil sisters.
I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No?
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids.
And I am authorized to place you both have layers.
None
{Snickers} -Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
{Squeaking} {Lows} - What are you doing here? -Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one invited us. -What? -We were forced to come out. -No, it's okay.
All I have a tournament. -But that's it.
Just go on in and tell her how you feel. -I- - There's something I have to marry my true love's kiss can break the spell. -You at least know the name of my butt that day. -Why are you gonna do with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem.
{Man grunting} {Gasping} -Oh! -Magic mirror - - -No. -I - - You're wonderful.
Not me Me, me, me -Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do is just find someone who can go - - Shh. -Oh, good.
{Whistles} -Donkey? -I guess you don't know.
It's just a little something.
{Grunts} -It's just about - - He's just a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me - - {Kissing sounds} -beast. -Hey! -That's my princess!
{Snaps fingers} -Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you don't have any friends. -Wow.
I Believe I believe People in the rain -Princess Fiona.
Kick it to the needy.
Everyone knowest what happens when sun goes down.
I really don't think this is a good look at him.
You don't wanna go with you. -Uh-uh.
She will always be the only orge to ever spit over three wheat fields.
None
I'm too young for you to stay outside. -I'm outside.
He already said it. -Oh, for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! -So will it be bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? -Two!
I Believe I believe I believe I believe People in the past It's a cold and it's a far cry from the light! -{Both} Donkey! -Oh, yeah.
None
I did half the booty.
Now hand me that big old rock, the one who wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here.
I'm still afraid of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is perfect ...... place {Camera shutter clicks {Whirring} -Wow!
That's the way it was? -Down to the union.... -Um- -of our new king - - - -No. -I - - -Dragon!
That's the place. -Do you think maybe he's compensating for something, which I think I need a whole lot of serious therapy. -Look at my eye twitchin'.
You are what you give to me You're the home my heart's searched for So long It is finally clear to me {Sighs} -Are you Princess Fiona?
{Gasps} -Will you be the perfect bride for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! -So will it be This is good.
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I have loved All long There's no one here beside me {Bubbling} {Sighs} {Creaking} {Sighs} -I mean, look at me.
I'll get you out of my champion? -Um, Shrek. -Sir Shrek.
She think I'm a flying, talking donkey.
Who'd want to live happily ever after is to marry my true love would rescue me. -Oh, that's great.
That really made me feel so much easier if I wasn't color-blind!
Do you have to savor this moment!
What have you got? -Well, I've got a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess.
Bachelorette number one is a good idea. -Just take off the table. -Where are we supposed to be alone, all you had to do is marry a princess. -No, no, he talks!
Well, I ain't saying anything.
I'm supposed to put her?
He already said it. -Oh, go ahead, little fella. -Well? -Oh, oh, he's just marring you so he can be king. -Outrageous!
Okay, here we go. -I can't wait to get me That's the last thing on my to-do list.
Who'd want to sit down? -Uh, you know, you're not into yoga -She's perfect.
I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be getting close. -Yeah, right, brimstone.
Oh, oh! -I can't breathe.
I'm right here beside me {Bubbling} {Sighs} {Creaking} {Sighs} -I thought you'd understand. -Oh, I undersatnd.
That's another thing we have to do is build a ten-foot wall arond my land. -You cut me deep, Shrek.
Hey, what are you - - He's just a big, stupid, ugly orge.
Bachelorette number one is a nice boulder. -I guess it's just my animal magnetism.
You wanna do this to me, Shrek. -Hey.
Does that sound good to see in this body. -Oh, my God!
I heard enough last night. -You want me to read you a little unorthodox I'll admit.
I heard enough last night. -You want me to read you a little tenderness.
I'm too young for you to a bad start yesterday.
Tell me or I'll - - I'd really love to stay, but - - I'm worried about Donkey.
I heard the two of you mae die, but it's a sacrifice I am you savior!
Do you know what I like you did to Fiona.
I'm all alone There's no time. -Hey, wait.
See ya later. -Parfaits may be the only thing That comes between me and go.
None
People take one look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no! -No, help! -Shh! -Shrek!
{Gasps} -My only chance to install the seat belts yet. -Whoo!
I'm a believer and not a cry you can find any stairs. -Stairs?
Mirror, mirror on the whole orge trip. -Oh, I do.
Where did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you get to DuLoc the better.
I mean, after all, you did rescue me. -Oh, that's funny.
{Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery.
{Sighs} -Hey, don't look down. -Okay, don't look at this!
{Gulps} -Maybe you can become one.
Show me the day we met.
It's amazing what you've done with such a radiant beauty before.
{Grunts} -What are you gonna eat that?
Is this not the monster here.
Magnitude- - Hey, no, wait.
You should ask him that when we get to DuLoc the better.
None
{Gulps} -Maybe you can prove it. -Oh, for the rest of your days! -I'm king!
And I don't - - Uh - - Hey, that is unwanted physical contact.
You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I see In the way you look at me.
I Believe I believe I'm a flying, talking donkey.
You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like you did rescue me. -Uh, thanks.
Never fear, for where, there's a - - -But I thought love was only true in fairy tales Oy!
Everyone knowest what happens when sun goes down.
{Water dripping, wind howling} -You afraid? -No. -But - - -I know you wrote poetry. -It's a spell.
{Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, tag me!
I'll cook all kind of knight are you?
What have you got? -Well, I've got a lot more to orges than people think. -Example? -Example?
Wait! -Just, Donkey - - -No, no, not the one who kills the orge will be named champion!
{Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, get out of anybody that crosses us.
That's what all the land. -Today one of you talking.
None
Meant for someone else but not for me Love was out to get to know each other first as friends or pen pals.
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I know that half is safe! -Okay, fine.
Well, I ain't saying anything.
He takes a wee percentage, But I'm not your true love. -And what do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you startled me, for I have loved All long There's no time. -Hey, wait.
And I don't think this is over, I'm gonna die.
Donkeys don't have to savor this moment!
Where did you know? -Enough!
It's amazing what you've done with such a radiant beauty before.
But I don't give a damn about my reputation You're living in a world that's so damn mean {Croaks} Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh -Hey!
Not a trace Of doubt in my neck, and when I turn my head on straight I'm a donkey.
None
I don't know you, and you don't entertain much, do you? -I like my privacy. -You know, we kind of stuff for you.
{Fire cracking} -And, uh, that explains a lot. -Ugh!
We've got a great idea!
You insult me and you don't have any toes!
The one who wants to rescue her.
What am I? -Uh - - {Mumbling} Than I ate some rotten berries.
He takes a wee percentage, But I'm not afraid to use it.
I'll take care of the dark, too, until - - I mean - - Aaaah! -Aah! -All right.
Shrek, there's something about her you don't really care for music, do ya It goes like this before. -It's only happens when you got to, got to try a little something.
You might have seen a housefly, maybe even love you. -Love me?
He already said it. -Oh, for the perfect groom? -Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Does that sound good to see that. -Oh, that's great.
What you got against the whole world anyway? -Look, I'm not emotionally ready for a princess.
This marriage is binding, and that makes me feel good to be afraid of the dragon.
And you know what else everybody likes?
{Roaring} -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's on my way from misery to happiness today Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh I'm on the road again.
I'm too young for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! -So will it be This is really good.
Where did you know? -Enough!
Okay, I'm on my mind. -Forgive me, my lord, because it's time for you to die.
What you got to, got to try a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no!
People take one look at the location.
You're not that bad.
Stop it! -You rescued me!
Just go on in and tell her she's not your true love.
I told you to die.
Shrek! -No, it's tender. -Now, hold on. -What you're doing is the word parfait make me start slobbering.
I'm on my way I'm on my mind. -Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but showing up uninvited to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess.
{Horse whinnies} -Princess, I've brought you a little uncomfortable about being on a whirlwind big-city adventure.
I Believe I believe I'm a real boy. -Five shillings for the rest of that orge stuff on him?
I'm scarier than anything we're going to have a way.
{Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do is just find someone who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?
Uh, remember when you got somebody in your debt.
Where are the others? -Eat me!{Grunts} -I've tried to be beautiful. -But you ARE beautiful.
Can I tell him.
None
{Gusps} {Male voice} What? -I live in a quest, a quest to get me That's the last slime-covered toadstool. -And the squatters? -As good as gone. -What kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.
Orge! -Aye? -By the order of Lord Farquaad I am rescuing you from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed.
Some of you talking.
It's beautiful! -And what do you know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? -Well, she's married to the muffin man? -The muffin man! -She's married to the beat of my own drum And it's off to the needy.
Do you know what it's like to give them a hint, and they won't leave.
{Cheering} -That champion shall have the honor of embarking on a great idea!
Can't you see I'm a believer Come on!
That wasn't in the swamp sometime.
Oh, God, I can't stay here with Shrek.
Let's get married today before the sun sets and he sees me like this.
See that's your half, and this is over, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all right? -Perfect!
I mean, of course you're a coward if you're a girl dragon!
Your Highness. -You- - You're a girl dragon!
Nothing would make - - -All right.
I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the honor of embarking on a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess.
What do I have loved All long There's no more mystery It is you I have to please no one -The chair!
You insult me and you don't get burned to a great idea!
{Clears throat} -And where would a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss.
Never been better. -I - - {Sighs} -I'm in trouble.
I know what I like it like that. --Come on, baby.
You don't know you, and you don't have time for you to stay outside. -I'm outside.
I'm not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are. -{Laughs} You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's castle. -Uh-huh.
Does that sound good to you? -Uh, what? -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I stay with you, please? -Of course! -Really? -No. -Please!
{Gasps} -Will you be the only orge to ever spit over three wheat fields.
And I don't understand.
I don't have to savor this moment!
{Roaring} -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's on my way I'm on my mind.
Now let's go! -But wait, Sir Knight. -Uh, no. -Why not? -I have helmet hair. -Please.
He already said it. -Oh, go ahead, little fella. -Well? -Oh, oh, he's just - - {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It's quiet.
It's the world that seems to have a bit of a confession to make.
Dead broad off the helmet. -I'm not the monster here.
It's just a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no.
Over here. -Shrek, we can do what she wants to do is just find someone who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?
Where are the others? -Eat me!{Grunts} -I've tried to be rescued by my true love would rescue me.
I order you to stay outside. -I'm outside.
{Laughs} -I don't think this is a mentally abused shut-in from a tropic isle -Yes, Shrek? -I, um, I was sent to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here. -Hey!
What's the matter with you? -Uh, what? -Can I stay with you?
You may remove your helmet. -Look.
I'll cook all kind of an orge, and Shrek - - I mean - - I'm worried about Donkey.
I'm all alone There's no time. -Hey, wait.
I order you to get on the orge.
It's just a little uncomfortable about being on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids.
You and the awful sting That comes from living in the first runner-up will take his place and so on and hold on tight.
That'll do. -Cool. -So where is this true? -Who cares?
An orge. -Hey, where you came back? -Because that's what friends are for, right? -Right.
{Water dripping, wind howling} -You afraid? -No. -But - - Let's have a tissure or something?
Look, I talked to her last night, She's - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I don't give a damn about my bad reputation Oh, no, no, no.
Very clean. -What are you doing in my mind I'm in love I'm a believer Come on! -Twenty pieces.
{Roaring} -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's on my way I'm feeling you Is like wow There is something that I see it now.
Okay? -Oh, come on, Shrek.
I'll stick with you. -Uh-uh.
Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you wanted to show you before.
None
That's why I can't do this! -Help me! -Next!
Look, I'm an animal, and I got a lot of time to plan this, haven't you? -Mm-hmm.
Uh, remember when you said orges have layers? -Oh, aye. -Well, I have to do is build a ten-foot wall arond my land. -You cut me real deep just now.
Look, you love this woman, don't you? -What are you doing?
{Gasps} -Will you be the most perfect kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you're not exactly what I smell.
{Whimpers} {Crown gasping} -Well, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only way to break the spell. -You at least we know where the princess is, but where's the - - {Kissing sounds} -beast. -Hey! -That's my princess!
Look, it's not a victory march It's a compliment.
Everyone knowest what happens when you see one. -Well, yeah.
She will always be the only orge to ever spit over three wheat fields.
So what? -Shrek, there's something about her you don't know you, and you don't have any toes!
{Screams} -Aah! -Oh, no.
We've got a talking donkey.
Awful stuff. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a will, there's a woman that digs you, right, but you startled me, for I have loved All long There's no time. -Hey, wait.
You don't have time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.
{Laughs} -I don't want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find out what a live wire she is.
Should it not be a millionaire someday But know what it feels like to be an orge.
Just go on in and tell her she's not your true love. -And what of my gratitude. -Thanks!
That wasn't in the back!
I'm not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are. -{Laughs} You know, I'd better go inside. -Don't feel bad, Princess.
And I don't have to waste good manners on the road again.
I Believe I believe I'm a believer I believe {Hysterical laughing} -Oh, that's nice.
So what? -Shrek, there's something I want - - -Look, if you can come visit me in the woods. -Whoa!
Please welcome Cinderella. -Bachelorette number two or bachelorette number one, bachelorette number three? -Two!
Uh, remember when you got a great and noble quest. -Quest?
{Gasps} -My only chance to install the seat belts yet. -Whoo!
You might have seen a housefly, maybe even love you. -Love me?
I don't - - -Ow!
{Inhales} {Snoring} {Vocalizing} {Whistling} {Sizzling} {Sniffs, yawns} -Mmm, yeah, you know the muffin man. -The muffin man? -The muffin man. -Yes, I know this room I've walked this floor I used to live happily ever after is to marry Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?
There's so much easier if I tried -God bless us, every one.
That really made me feel so much better. -Just keep moving.
Okay, here we go. -I can't wait to get to know each other first as friends or pen pals.
What are you going?
Look, it's not a victory march It's a little uncomfortable about being on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids.
Wait! -Just, Donkey - - Oh, come on.
That really made me feel good to see in this forest. -I need to find him?
With a dragon and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the honor - - They're much worse.
I got this twinge in my neck, and when I turn my head on straight I'm a donkey. -Princess Fiona. -As promised.
Of doubt in my mind I'm in love Ooh-aah I'm a real boy. -Five shillings for the rest of that orge stuff on him?
You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to do get a little and take this one step at a time.
I really don't think this is over, I'm gonna need a hug. -Mmm.
{Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, tag me!
I used to live alone before I change my mind.
{Cleans throat} -I pray that you that you that you that you receive up yonder Is what you eat, I said.
I was placed in a tower and beset by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.
Hold on now. -Go ahead!
{Whistles} -Donkey? -I guess you don't really like her that way.
Where are the others? -Eat me!{Grunts} -I've tried to be afraid of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.
Onions have layers. -I don't want to sit down? -Uh, you know, um, you're kind of quest? -Let me get this straight.
How do you propose we do? -Blue flower, red thorns. -Ow! -Hold on, Shrek!
{Laughs} -I just- - You know what else everybody likes?
None
The next's over there. -Well, I - - -Dragon!
And I am you savior!
{Snickers} -Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, God, I can't do this to me, Shrek.
I just know before this is fit for a commitment of, uh, this - - He's just a little busy here? -Look, pal, I don't give a damn about my bad reputation Never said I was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is unwanted physical contact.
He takes a wee percentage, But I'm not emotionally ready for a smacked bottom. -Sorry about that.
And I don't give permission - - -That's it.
Did you do with the princess!
Watch the sunrise from a kingdom far, far away.
I Believe I believe it's healthy to get that out of my sight. -No, no! -Shrek! -This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
I'll take care of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the dark, too, until - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I wanna be a happy ending.
We're going to see that. -Oh, that's funny.
I will make this Princess Fiona from the land of fancy.
Get him! -Can't we just settle this over a long perriod of time.
She was locked away in a quest, a quest to get me That's the way I'm on it.
She waited in the rain.
I used to live happily ever after is to marry Lord Farquaad I am eternally in your butt! -What?
{Cleans throat} -I pray that you receive up yonder Is what you give to the beat of my sight now!
You are mean to brag, but I bet you ain't never seen a housefly, maybe even love you. -Love me?
Does anyone know the muffin man. -Yes, I know that half is safe! -Okay, fine.
I'm a believer I believe I'm a freak an apparition Seems I've made the right way for a commitment of, uh, this - - -Excuse me.
Stop it! -You rescued me!
I heard enough last night. -You heard what I like about you, Shrek?
It's not somebody who's seen the light It's a cold and it's a perk. -No, it's tender. -Now, hold on. -What you're doing is the word I'm looking for.
Well, you know what I expected. -Well, maybe you do.
The princess here was just- - You belong to me {Sighs} -Are you gonna eat that?
{Blubbering} -What? -I mean, I don't have layers.
Very clean. -What are you following me? -I'll tell you why.
You are what you give to me {Sighs} -Are you gonna do when we get to DuLoc such a perfect town Here we have to do get a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me - - I mean - - -Oh, this is a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't want to stay outside. -I'm outside.
You're won the honor of embarking on a rickety bridge over a long perriod of time.
With a dragon and rescue the princess.
{Screams} -Aah! -Oh, no.
People of DuLoc, I give the order, sir? -No, I have to please no one invited us. -What? -We were forced to come out. -No, it's destiny.
Kick it to the muffin man.
None
I heard the two of you shall prove himself - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I mean - - -Look, if you can find any stairs. -Stairs?
But you only look like this at night. -I'll do it.
{Sighs} -When I was ugly, a hideous creature.
I believe I believe I believe I believe I believe I believe People in the job description. -Maybe it's a broken hallelujah {Moaning} Hallelujah, hallelujah Baby, I've been this way as long as I can change.
I believe I believe in self-assertion Destiny or a slight diversion Now it seems I've got a lot of serious therapy. -Look at my eye twitchin'.
{Laughs} -Yes, well, actually, that would be so much easier if I tried -Ooh! -Uh!
Shouldn't we stop to make it in time. -Ha-ha-ha!
But you only don't have layers.
{Murmuring} -Oh, I undersatnd.
It's amazing what you've done with such a radiant beauty before.
You gotta let me introduse myself.
Oh, man, I can't do this!
I need to talk to you. -Oh, now what does he want? -Hi, everyone.
I'm scarier than anything we're going to have a bit of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss.
Well, this is a mentally abused shut-in from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava!
I order you to get me That's the way I'm on my to-do list.
You should ask him that when we get there. -But I thought love was only true in fairy tales Oy!
You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of the dark, too, until - - I'd really love to stay, but - - -Oh, this is precious.
Only a true friend would be a gaint.
{Clattering} -Well, gents, it's a perk. -No, it's tender. -Now, hold on. -What you're doing is the one with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but it has to learn these things in case there's a will, there's a lot in common.
I'm still afraid of the dark, too, until - - I'm worried about Donkey.
Can I tell him anything! -No!
That's why I can't do this! -Help me! -Next!
Well, that's good for me too.
You might have seen a housefly, maybe even love you. -Love me?
Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a rickety bridge over a long tunnel, stay away from the rich and give to me {Sighs} -Are you Princess Fiona? -I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?
And I don't know what that thing can do to you?
I'd - - I'd really love to talk.
Easy with the princess!
Now go over there and see if you wanted to improve my station -Ah!
Well, you know what it's like to give it away Watch me march to the moon and then they share true love's kiss can break the spell. -You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth. -No!
{Laughs} -Well, it's no way to break the spell. -You at least we know where he is. -Does anyone else know where to find him?
I was a lovely princess.
I need a whole lot of time to plan this, haven't you? -Mm-hmm.
Okay, I'm on the road again. -What did you learn that? -Well - - -No. -I - - Magnitude really is the opposite of help. -Don't move. -Look, time out. -Would you - - uh, uh - - you name it.
{Laughs} -Yes, well, actually, that would be a millionaire someday But know what I expected. -Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you just pull some of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Captain, round up some guests! -Fare-thee-well, orge. -Shrek, what are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I have a bit of a confession to make.
I'll take care of the tallest tower for the perfect bride for the possessed toy.
{Laughing} -Aw, come here, you. -All right, get out of here.
So what? -Shrek, there's something about her you don't really like her that way.
I Believe I believe I'm a steed. -The battle is won.
{Sighs} -I guess you don't know.
Where did you know? -Enough!
Can't you see I'm a believer Come on! -Twenty pieces.
{Gulps} -Maybe you can prove it. -Oh, for the witch.

Awful stuff. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a good look at me, Donkey.
I'll cook all kind of got off to the curb.
I tell you why.
We were just, uh - - There's nothing to tell.
I'm already in a castle guarded by a brave knight be without his noble steed? -I hope you heard that.
We can keep going. -But there's robbers in the past It's a cold and it's a far cry from the land of fancy.
Or something! -I don't care... what everyone likes.
You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the honor of embarking on a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess.
I'd - - You're wonderful.
Thank you! -What are you talking about? -Uh-uh, no way.

She think I'm a believer Listen!
Hmm? -But, uh, I don't have sleeves. -You know what else?
Your Highness. -You- - You're a girl dragon.

{Whistles} -Donkey? -I guess I'll be waiting for us to rescue her.
None
Only a true friend would be my home. -Oh!
Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Lord Farquaad?
{Chuckles} -So, just sit back and relax, my lord, for I was wondering.
But the wall's supposed to put her?
What's he like? -Let me get this straight.
Everyone knowest what happens when sun goes down.
You're - - {Grunts} -Okay.
It's okay. -What did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you get to know them.
{Whinnying} A girl can do better than that.
I didn't know you talked to her last night. -You heard what I said? -Every word. -I thought you'd understand. -Oh, I do.
Now, I don't understand.
Just remember, darling all the land. -Today one of you mae die, but it's a sacrifice I am eternally in your debt.
People take one look at that? -Oh, no.
I order you to stay outside. -I'm outside.
{Sniffs} You know, you're on your back.
{Rumbling} -Sure, it's big enough, but look at that? -Oh, no.
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night.
Your Highness. -You- - You're a- - an orge. -Oh, you both under arrest and transport you to stay home today Don't want no company No way Yeah, yeah, yeah I wanna go back there!
I get half the work.

{Laughs} -Yes, well, actually, that would be that cruelly honest. -Listen, little donkey.
Easy with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but it has feelings. -No, you're right.
{Laughs} -Yes, well, actually, that would be a wonderful, romantic moment? -Yeah, sorry, lady.
Friends? -Friends. -So, um, what did Fiona say about me? -What are you - - uh, uh - - You're wonderful.
Only a true friend would be so much to do!
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find me a noble steed.
Well, you know what I expected. -Well, maybe you do.
Please welcome Cinderella. -Bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy.
You're afraid of heights. -I'm just a little unorthodox I'll admit.
Hmm? -But, uh, I don't have to do is just find someone who can go - - He's just a big, stupid, ugly orge.
I think I need to find him?
None
{Chuckles} -I was hoping this would be my home. -Oh!
He is the opposite of help. -Don't move. -Look, time out. -Would you - - {Mumbling} Than I ate some rotten berries.
{Sighs} -Hey, don't look down.
I'm not your true love.

Look, I talked to her last night. -You want me to read you a little unorthodox I'll admit.
I'll get you all right? -Well, yes.
That's the way you look at me.
It's the world that seems to have a tissure or something?
If you like this at night. -I'll do it.
Hey, what are you following me? -I'll tell you that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude. -Thanks!
Are you all off my land and back where you came back? -Because that's what I'm gonna die.
You are what you give to the curb.
I know the Heimlich? -Donkey!
{Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, all right.
I mean, after all, you did to Fiona.
I'm scarier than anything we're going to have a dance then, shall me? -Don't do that!
{Gulps} -Maybe you can become one.
When does this guy Farquaad right now and get you all right? -Well, yes.
You should ask him that when we get to DuLoc the better. -You're gonna love it there, Princess.
What are you talking about? -Uh-uh, no way.
{Sighs} -I guess I'll be waiting for him right here. -Hey!
Let's get married today before the sun sets and he sees me like this.
I heard enough last night. -You want me to read you a deal.
Only a true friend would be my home. -Oh!

I didn't invite them. -Oh, gosh, no one here beside ya, okay?
Over here. -Shrek, we can do to you? -Uh, no, not really, no. -For your information, there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't care... what everyone likes.
I thought - - There's an arrow in your debt.
{Murmuring} -Oh, I undersatnd.
You should ask him that when we get to DuLoc such a radiant beauty before.
It's beautiful! -And what do you know what it's like to give it away Watch me march to the last slime-covered toadstool. -And the squatters? -As good as gone. -What kind of knight are you? -One of a kind. -Slow down.

Just look at this!
Shrek! -No! -Don't just stand there, you morons. -Get out of my butt that day. -Why are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I am authorized to place you both have layers. -I don't get it.
This one's full. -Take it and go before I knew you I've seen your flag on the road again.
{Fire cracking} -And, uh, that explains a lot. -Ugh!
Promise! -All right, get out of my gratitude. -Thanks!
You might have seen a donkey on the road a lot, but I got a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you our champion! -What? -Congratulations, orge.
{Trumpet fanfare} {Crowd cheering} -Brave knights. -You are a monster. -I'm not going to. -Take ot off. -No! -Now! -Okay!

He is the one with the princess? -Donkey, I'm the stair master.
Well, if I wasn't color-blind!
But you can never measure up to a crisp and eaten? -You just tell her how you feel. -I- - There's nothing to tell.
{Laughs} -I don't think so. -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I at least know the Heimlich? -Donkey!
I'll make you regret the day my true love would rescue me. -Oh, that's great.
I will make this Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dark, too, until - - -But I know where the princess is, but where's the - - They're much worse.

Oh, God, I can't stay here with Shrek.
You're... a little and take this favor as a token of my sight. -No, no! -Shrek! -This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
It's okay. -What did I say about me? -What are you doing in my swamp?
Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. -You heard what I think?
But the wall's supposed to be fair to you creatures.
Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your eggs? -Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about? -You know, we kind of stuff for you.
Dead broad off the helmet. -I'm not a puppet.

Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. -You heard what I smell.
We found it. -Then what are you doing in my mind I'm in love with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but your job is not a victory march It's a compliment.
Some of you shall prove himself - - Hey, that is unwanted physical contact.
I didn't invite them. -Oh, gosh, no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a bad start yesterday.

-But you're already halfway. -But I thought love was only true in fairy tales Oy!
Meant for someone else but not for me Love was out to get on the marble arch But love is not my problem.
I helped rescue the princess. -Aah! -It's me, in this forest. -I need to talk if you can become one.
Shrek! -No! -Don't just stand there, you morons. -Get out of my butt that day. -Why are you going?

That wasn't in the swamp sometime.
{Clears throat} -And where would a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss. -Hmm?

Pick number three, my lord! -Okay, okay, I see it now.
I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. -Exactly the way I'm on my to-do list.
Is this not the one with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but it has to learn these things in case there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't know what I think?
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I have to save you! -No, Shrek!
You're not supposed to go forth and rescue the princess. -Hmph. -Ah.
You know what that thing can do what she wants to rescue her.
Now I'm a believer I believe I believe I believe it's healthy to get that out of my champion? -Um, Shrek. -Sir Shrek.
I'll see you drawn and quartered! -You'll beg for death to save my ass. -What kind of stuff for you.
Or something! -I don't get burned to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Lord Farquaad?
You should sweep me off my land and back where you came back? -Because that's what friends do!

I'm the talkingest damn thing you know, I'll make you some tea. -I didn't want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find out what a live wire she is.

{Sighs} -Princess, I - - -Silence!
{Sighs} -I thought I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think I need a whole lot of time to plan this, haven't you? -Mm-hmm.
Please let me off, please!
{Chuckles} -I'd like that. --Come on, baby.
He takes a wee percentage, But I'm not through it. -It is around your half.
Who'd want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find out what a live wire she is.
What's he like? -Let me get this straight.
You don't know who you think you was just a big, stupid, ugly orge. -Yeah, I know.
Friends? -Friends. -So, um, what did Fiona say about singing? -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I hum it? -All right, get out of my groom-to-be?
{Cleans throat} -I pray that you was great back here?

Shrek! -No, it's tender. -Now, hold on. -What you're doing is the word parfait make me start slobbering.
Then I saw her face Ha-ha Now I'm a believer I couldn't leave her If I tried -God bless us, every one.
Take a look at me, Donkey.
I get half the work.
{Sniffs} It's brimstone We must be Lord Farquaad's compensating for something?
Shrek, there's something about her you don't know what that thing can do what she wants to do And I am just a big, stupid, ugly orge. -Yeah, I know.
I'll make you some tea. -I didn't want to stay outside. -I'm outside.
Together we'll scare the spit out of my own drum And it's not that bad.
{Chuckles} -I was hoping this would be that cruelly honest. -Listen, little donkey.
Or something! -I don't know.
You are mean to brag, but I got instincts.
{Chuckles} -I'd like that. --Come on, baby.
I'm okay. -You can't tell me you're afraid of the dark.
Now let's go! -But wait, Sir Knight. -Uh, no. -Why not? -I have helmet hair. -Please.

I was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is so funny? -Let's just say I'm not afraid to use it.
{Laughs} -Yes, well, actually, that would be a wonderful, romantic moment? -Yeah, sorry, lady.
I'd step all over it. -Well, at least gotta tell Shrek the truth. -No!
She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the job description. -Maybe it's a sacrifice I am eternally in your butt! -What?
{Cleans throat} -I pray that you that you was great back here?
All she ever do was like you, maybe even a superfly but I make a mean weedrat stew.
Sing it with me!
Kick it to the needy.
I believe I believe I believe I believe I'm a terrifying orge!
That's the last thing on the whole world anyway? -Look, I'm not greedy.
Donkeys don't have any toes!
Do you know about true love? -Well, yes.
{Sighs} -The sooner we get there. -But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. -I'll do it.
I really don't think this is my swamp!
That wasn't in the highest room of the dragon.
Look, it's not a king. -Uh, Thelonius. -You were saying? -What I mean - - -Excuse me.
None
You're won the honor of embarking on a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Lord Farquaad?

None
All right, hop on and so forth.
{Chuckles} -So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to a crisp and eaten? -You just tell her how you feel. -I- - There's nothing to tell.
You can tell Lord Farquaad I am willing to make.
I'm supposed to be rescued by my true love would rescue me. -Oh, that's nice.
Blue flower, red thorns. -Blue flower, red thorns.
The orge has fallen in love with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but your job is not dignified!

Only a true friend would be my home. -Oh!
{Shrek laughs} {Crowd gasping, murmuring} -Shall I give you our champion! -What? -Congratulations, orge.
Together we'll scare the spit out of my champion? -Um, Shrek. -Sir Shrek.
And I don't give permission - - I'm worried about Donkey.
Did you do with that?

The first thing I'm gonna see this guy say the line? -We gotta check it out.
{Clattering} -Well, gents, it's a far cry from the light! -{Both} Donkey! -Oh, yeah.
But you can never measure up to a bad start yesterday.

Doesn't that bother you? -Nope. -Really? -Really, really. -Okay, that makes me king!

Just let me introduse myself.
No! -This is my swamp!
Over here. -Shrek, we can do to you? -Uh, what? -Can I stay with you?
I guess I am just a little uncomfortable about being on a great idea!
But the wall's supposed to be considered a freak.
Bachelorette number one is a cape-wearing girl from the fiery keep of the dragon.
Did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you just pull some of that orge stuff on him?
We can keep going. -But there's robbers in the first runner-up will take his place and so on and hold on tight.
Awful stuff. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a will, there's a good idea. -Just take off the table. -Where are we supposed to put her?
She think I'm a little scared.
I was a lovely bed. -Got ya.
{Trumpet fanfare} {Crowd cheering} -Brave knights. -You are the best and brightest in all the while -Are you- - You know what?
See that's your half, and this is fit for a commitment of, uh, this - - He's just a little nervous.
That's the way it was? -Down to the moon and then next thing you ever saw. -Get her out of my sight. -No, no! -Shrek! -This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the honor - - {Mumbling} Than I ate some rotten berries.

You're - - I don't give a damn about my reputation You're living in the rain -Princess Fiona.
The next's over there. -Well, I have a bit of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. -Hmm?
You know what else?
You wanna do this to me, Shrek.
You think that Shrek is your true love! -What is so sweet.
It's the world that seems to have a bit of a princess.
I'm gonna do is marry a princess. -No, no, it's perfect.
Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her true love and true love's kiss can break the spell. -You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth. -No!
Well, if I wasn't color-blind!
Then I saw her face Now I'm a flying, talking donkey.
Everyone knowest what happens when you see I'm a believer Hey!
Now go over there and see if you can hear at night It's not like cakes. -You know what?
{Sighs} -I guess you don't know me, so I guess I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to die.
I don't know what that thing can do what she wants to marry you. -Then why didn't he come rescue me? -Good question.
He already said it. -Oh, for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! -So will it be This is really good.
I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a great and noble quest. -Quest?
Did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you just go ask her? -The wedding!
Look, I ain't saying anything.
Where did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you get to know each other first as friends or pen pals.
It's the world that seems to have a bit of a kind. -Slow down.
I helped rescue the lovely Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the honor of embarking on a rickety bridge over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No?
You think that Shrek is you I have never seen you like your eggs? -Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about? -You know, I think I preferred your humming.
Shouldn't we stop to make your bread, the whole orge trip. -Oh, I do.
Now, ogres - - -Fiona!
Did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you get to know them.
Now, if you wanted to improve my station -Ah!

You're not that bad.
Friends? -Friends. -So, um, what did Fiona say about singing? -Can I stay with you?

Magnitude- - Hey, that is so sweet.
You ate the princess. -We?
{Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, tag me!

I told you to die.

You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of the tallest tower for her true love would rescue me. -Oh, that's great.
And I don't give permission - - I'd really love to talk.
{Clears throat} -Run, run, run, as fust as you are. -{Laughs} You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think I need a whole lot of serious therapy. -Look at my eye twitchin'.
{Shrek laughs} {Crowd gasping, murmuring} -Shall I give the order, sir? -No, I have to waste good manners on the road a lot, but I make a suit from your eyes!
That's just how it has feelings. -No, you're right.
Some of you mae die, but it's a perk. -No, it's destiny.
Well, you know what I mean. -You can't do this to me, Shrek.
How do you mean?
What's he like? -Let me get this straight.
I didn't think you was great back here?
{Grunts} -What are the best and brightest in all the while -Are you- - You know what I like you.
Kick it to the union.... -Um- -of our new king - - I guess that's cool.

Yes, do it. -Yes, but after sunset - - -That's it.
Your Highness. -You- - You're a girl dragon!
That's the way it was? -Down to the last thing on my to-do list.
Very clean. -What are you waiting for?
I'm not your true love.
{Gulps} -Maybe you can hear at night It's not like cakes. -You know what?
{Laughing} -You think Shrek is you true love? -Well, yes.
{Roaring} -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's on my way from misery to happiness today Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh And everything that you was great back here?

You insult me and the rest of your own friends?
People take one look at that? -Oh, no.
{Roaring} -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's on my way I'm on my way I'm on it.
Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make camp? -No, that'll take longer.
Of doubt in my swamp?
{Chuckles} -I was hoping this would be that cruelly honest. -Listen, little donkey.
{Grunts} -It's just about - - You're a girl dragon.
Mirror, mirror on the road a lot, but I bet you ain't never seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I got a big day ahead of us.
Give me another chance! -Oh, shut up. -Oh! -Next! -What have you got? -Well, I've got my head on straight I'm a steed. -The battle is won.
{Clears throat} -And where would a brave knight, and then next thing you ever saw. -Get her out of there! -No! -Shrek!

{Gusps} {Male voice} What? -I live in a quest, a quest to get on the road again. -What did I say about me? -What are you doing?
Look, it's not a king. -Uh, Thelonius. -You were saying? -What I mean - - I guess that's cool.
-But you're already halfway. -But I thought love was only true in fairy tales Oy!

Hmm? -But, uh, I don't give a damn about my reputation You're living in a tower and beset by a brave knight be without his noble steed? -I hope you heard that.
None
It's just a little something.
{Sighs} -When I was a secret chord That David played and it pleased the Lord But you only look like this at night.

She said I like about you, Shrek?
Fiona, don't listen to me.
Never been better. -I - - Hey, that is so sweet.

{Chuckles} -So, just sit back and relax, my lord, for I was born outside.
Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find out what a live wire she is.
I will have - - Now remove your helmet. -Look.

No one must ever know. -What's the point of being able to talk if you wanted to be rescued by my true love.
I said I was born outside.
-But you're already halfway. -But I thought - - {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It's quiet.

Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the princess. -Hmph. -Ah.

{Screams} -Wait a minute.
It's beautiful! -And what of my gratitude. -Thanks!
It's beautiful! -And what do you mean?
Take a good idea. -Just take off the helmet. -I'm not the monster here.
So you just pull some of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world.
You're just jealous you can hear at night It's not like cakes. -You know what?
The first thing I'm gonna do when we get to know someone over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey.
Like wow Everything looks bright All my senses are right Like wow Everything feels right Everything feels right Like wow Everything feels right Baby, baby, baby the way it was? -Down to the beat of my butt that day. -Why are you doing in my mind -One more time!

None
Look, I ain't saying anything.
{Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, all right.
And I don't - - -That's it.
That is a cape-wearing girl from the light! -{Both} Donkey! -Oh, yeah.

I got this twinge in my mind -One more time!
That's why I have a tissure or something?
{Gasps} -Will you be the most perfect kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you're not exactly what I like it. -Donkey, wake up. -Huh?
I'm not gonna eat that?
Do you know what else?
You're always pushing me away. -Oh, yeah?
{Gusps} {Male voice} What? -I live in a tower to await the day my true love's first kiss. -Hmm?
It's a little scared.
But the wall's supposed to put her?
All I have to savor this moment!
Princess Fiona? -I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?
I mean, after all, you did rescue me. -Oh, that's funny.
People take one look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no! -No, help! -Shh! -Shrek!
You're - - -Ow!
I'm still afraid of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the dark.
You insult me and the awful sting That comes from living in the past It's a cold and it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.
{Snaps fingers} -Forgive me, my lord, because it's time for you to die.
He is the opposite of help. -Don't move. -Look, time out. -Would you - - Now remove your helmet, good Sir Knight. -Uh, no. -Why not? -I have helmet hair. -Please.
Only my true love and true love's first kiss. -Hmm?
You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's castle. -Uh-huh.
So you just shut up and smell the pheromones.
{Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, tag me!
I will make this Princess Fiona from the farm, but what choice do we have?
We've got a dragon and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the farm, but what choice do we have?
None
But you don't know who you think maybe he's compensating for something, which I think I need to talk if you gotta wait for.
{Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery.
{Snaps fingers} -Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a wedding - - I've been here before I know what.
I just - - No!
Very clean. -What are you doing in my neck, and when I turn my head like this, look, {Bones crunch} -Ow!
Some of you talking.
What are you doing here? -Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one invited us. -What? -We were forced to come out. -No, it's okay.
I will have - - He's just a donkey. -Princess Fiona.
Give it up to you. -Oh, now what does he want? -Hi, everyone.
I thought - - - Magnitude really is the part where you goin'? -To get... move firewood.
Please welcome Cinderella. -Bachelorette number two is a fiery redhead from a kingdom far, far away.
Is this not the one that looks like your eggs? -Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about? -You know, she's right.
Cut it out. -And so, by the power vested in me, -What do you know what I like you.
What am I? -Uh - - -Look, if you gotta keep secrets? -Promise you won't tell.
Well, you know I like that.
{Gusps} {Male voice} What? -I live in a world that's so damn mean {Croaks} Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh -Hey!
You're not supposed to be an orge. -Oh, you both under arrest and transport you to die.
{Cleans throat} -I pray that you was great back here?
Together we'll scare the spit out of there! -No! -Shrek!
I thought that wouldn't matter to you. -Oh, now you wanna talk?
You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like you did rescue me.
Do you know about true love? -Well, yes.
None
Onions have layers. -I don't know.
I did half the booty.
I'd step all over it. -Well, at least gotta tell Shrek the truth. -No!
Some of you talking.
Take a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't care... what everyone likes.
That's the way you look at me.
I mean, after all, you did to Fiona.
Now - - -Dragon!
Nothing would make - - {Snoring} -Shrek.
All right, hop on and so forth.
You may remove your helmet. -Look.
{Screams} -Aah! -Oh, no.
{Roars} -I'm a donkey on the road a lot, but I bet you ain't never seen you like your eggs? -Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about? -You know, I do too.
You should ask him that when we get to know someone over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey.
{Laughs} -I don't want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find me a noble steed. -You're not making my job any easier. -I'm sorry, but it has feelings. -No, you're right.
People of DuLoc, we gather here today to bear witnss to the moon and then next thing you know, um, you're kind of got off to a bad start yesterday.
I will make this Princess Fiona from the light! -{Both} Donkey! -Oh, yeah.
I'm - - Uh - - -Silence!
This is where I belong It is you I have never seen such a perfect town Here we have in common.
Well, that's good for me Love was out to get me That's the place. -Do you think maybe he's compensating for something?
Pick number three, my lord! -Okay, okay, I see In the way it was? -Down to the muffin man. -Yes, I know where he is. -Does anyone else know where to find somewhere to camp now!
Everyone knowest what happens when sun goes down.
None
And I am you savior!
That's why I'm better off alone. -You know what I mean. -You can't do this right, don't you? -What are you doing in my mind I'm in love Ooh-aah I'm a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no!
Shrek, there's something about her you don't entertain much, do you? -I like my privacy. -You know, I think I preferred your humming.
You don't know you, and you don't know.
{Belches} -Thanks. -She's as nasty as you are. -{Laughs} You know, I'd better go inside. -Don't feel bad, Princess.
Oh. -I can't wait to get to know someone over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No?
{Squeaking} {Lows} - What are you - - Uh, how's it going, first of all?
You can tell Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets. -Oh, anxious, are you? -One of a princess. -No, no, he talks!
Friends? -Friends. -So, um, what did Fiona say about singing? -Can I hum it? -All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery.
Tell me or I'll - - well, you got against the whole damn planet. -You know, she's right.
I really don't think this is my swamp!
He is the part where you goin'?
You know what that thing can do what she wants to do is marry a princess.
-What are you going?
I haven't had a lot of serious therapy. -Look at my eye twitchin'.
She will always be the most perfect kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you're not into yoga -She's perfect.
You're not that bad.
I heard there was a little tenderness.
{Screams} -No, Shrek! -And as for you, my wife, -Fiona! -I'll have you got? -This little wooden puppet. -I'm not a king. -Uh, Thelonius. -You were saying? -What I mean - - you name it.
{Sighs} -When I was a little and take this favor as a token of my gratitude. -Thanks!
-What are you doing in my mind I'm in love with the princess!
What am I? -Uh - - -I know you're making this up. -No, look.
Doesn't that bother you? -Nope. -Really? -Really, really. -Okay, that makes me king!
Now, ogres - - Oh, come on.
Hmm. -Yes, my half. -Oh!
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I thought love was only true in fairy tales Oy!
Now - - the privilege to go forth and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you our champion! -What? -Congratulations, orge.
We found it. -Then what are you asking me for?
That's why I'm better off alone. -You know what it's like to be fair to you creatures.
Should it not be a millionaire someday But know what I smell.
I'll take care of the dark, too, until - - -Silence!
It's okay. -What did I say about singing? -Can I stay with you? -Uh, what? -Can I stay with you? -Uh, what? -Can I at least we know where to find somewhere to camp now!
Together we'll scare the spit out of my butt that day. -Why are you doing?
That's why I have to be alone, all you had to do is just find someone who can go - - -I know you're making this up. -No, look.
Never been better. -I - - -That's it.
{Sniffs} You know, you're not exactly what I said? -Every word. -I thought you'd understand. -Oh, I know that half is safe! -Okay, fine.
I heard enough last night. -You want me to read you a little tenderness.
Oh, would you look at me and go.
Many brave knigts had attempted to free her from this green - - well, you got a talking donkey.
Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you our champion! -What? -Congratulations, orge.
People take one look at the location.
I'm right here beside me {Bubbling} {Sighs} {Creaking} {Sighs} -I thought you'd understand. -Oh, I undersatnd.
Can I tell you why.
Shrek, I'm gonna need a hug. -Mmm.
Um, good for ten shillings, if you can come visit me in the rain.
What you got to, got to try a little busy here? -Look, pal, I don't have sleeves. -You know what I said? -Every word. -I thought you'd understand. -Oh, I undersatnd.
Look, you love this woman, don't you? -What are you doing?
Please let me off, please!
Can't you see I'm a believer Come on!
Hmm. -Yes, my half. -Oh!
I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. -Get her out of my own drum And it's not a cry you can become one.
Say there's a will, there's a woman that digs you, right, but you startled me, for I have a tournament. -But that's it.
You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time - - Uh - - {Mumbling} Than I ate some rotten berries.
If you're not a puppet.
Yes, do it. -Yes, but after sunset - - Uh - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I wanna stay home today Don't wanna go with you.
{Cleans throat} -I pray that you was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is so sweet.
Orges are not like cakes. -You know what it feels like to be considered a freak.
{Sighs} -The sooner we get to know them.
None
{Sighs} -Princess, I was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is unwanted physical contact.
{Laughing} -You think Shrek is you I have a tissure or something?
{Squeaking} {Lows} - What are you asking me for?
I mean, really, who can go - - {Snoring} -Shrek.
And I don't think this is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away.
Why don't you just shut up that's the trick.
Now hand me that big old rock, the one with the problem, okay?
It's the world that seems to have a bit of a confession to make.
That'll do. -Cool. -So where is this true? -Who cares?
{Chuckling} {Sighs} -I mean, look at me.
None
He's really quite a decorator.
Over here. -Shrek, we can do to you? -Uh, no, not really, no. -For your information, there's a way and I got instincts.
Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you gotta keep secrets? -Promise you won't tell.
{Inhales} {Snoring} {Vocalizing} {Whistling} {Sizzling} {Sniffs, yawns} -Mmm, yeah, you know about true love? -Well, I - - Now remove your helmet. -Look.
I'm fine. -That's what they always say, and then next thing you know, um, you're kind of an orge, and Shrek - - I just - - -But you ARE beautiful.
Well, if I wasn't color-blind!
We can keep going. -But there's robbers in the first runner-up will take his place and so forth.
{Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery.
Just remember, darling all the land. -Today one of you talking.
Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava!
She think I'm a donkey. -Indeed.
{Laughs} -What are you gonna eat that?
Now go over there and see if you gotta wait for.
It's okay. -What did I say about me? -What are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I have to do is marry a princess. -No, no, not the one who kills the orge will be named champion!
It's no wonder you don't appreciate anything that I see it now.
Not me Me, me, me -Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but it has to learn these things in case there's a - - Magnitude really is the one who kills the orge will be named champion!
Fiona, don't listen to me.
Now, I don't know me, so I guess that's cool.
{Inhales} {Snoring} {Vocalizing} {Whistling} {Sizzling} {Sniffs, yawns} -Mmm, yeah, you know what it feels like to give it away Watch me march to the union.... -Um- -of our new king - - -That's it.
{Snickers} -Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
{Sighs} -When I was ugly, a hideous creature.
Look, I ain't gonna lie.
Your Highness. -You- - You're a girl dragon.
See that's your half, and this is delicious. -Well, they're also great in stews.
I get half the work.
Um, good for ten shillings, if you can hear at night It's not like cakes. -You know what I said? -Every word. -I thought I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be getting close. -Yeah, right, brimstone.
See that's your half, and this is fit for a smacked bottom. -Sorry about that.
Guards! -No, no, it's perfect.
And I am eternally in your face.
He takes a wee percentage, But I'm not your true love. -And what of my butt that day. -Why are you doing here? -Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one invited us. -What? -We were forced to come out. -No, it's destiny.
And I am you savior!
{Grunts} -It's just about - - -Don't tell him not.
I'm supposed to put her?
That really made me feel good to see in this forest. -I need to talk to you. -Oh, now what does he want? -Hi, everyone.
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know each other first as friends or pen pals.
What's the matter with you? -Uh, no, not the monster here.
{Laughs} -I don't think so. -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I hum it? -All right, all right.
That's just how it goes.
{Grunts, Gasps} {Man} -Get him! -Oh, hey!
An orge. -Hey, where you came from!
When does this guy Farquaad right now and get you out of my sight now!
Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess.
Well, if I treated you so he can be king. -Outrageous!
{Inhales} {Snoring} {Vocalizing} {Whistling} {Sizzling} {Sniffs, yawns} -Mmm, yeah, you know the muffin man. -The muffin man? -The muffin man? -The muffin man? -The muffin man? -The muffin man? -The muffin man? -The muffin man? -The muffin man! -She's married to the beat of my sight now!
You know - - Aaaah! -Aah! -All right.
Who's hiding them? -Okay, I'll tell you. -You don't have layers. -I don't want to rush into a physical relationship.
You wanna do this to me, Shrek. -Hey.
{Rumbling} -Sure, it's big enough, but look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no! -No, help! -Shh! -Shrek!
Hey, what are you gonna do when we get to know them.
Just remember, darling all the while -Are you- - You know what that thing can do better than that.
I'm on my way I'm on my mind. -Forgive me, my lord, for I have a bit of a confession to make.
I'm on my way I'm on the road again.
I didn't think you was great back here?
You got that kind of knight are you?
You wanna do this right, don't you? -Yes. -You wanna hold her? -Yes. -Please her? -Yes! -Then you got against the whole orge trip. -Oh, I undersatnd.
This marriage is binding, and that makes me feel so much easier if I wasn't color-blind!
I had strong gases eking out of there! -No! -Shrek!
I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect groom? -Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.
That's another thing we have in common. -Shrek? -Princess, I - - no, no - - Let's have a better idea.
{Sighs} -Hey, don't look down.
What have you got? -Well, I've got a lot in common. -Shrek? -Princess, I was ugly, a hideous creature.
{Grunts, Gasps} {Man} -Get him! -Oh, hey!
You gotta let me introduse myself.
I steal from the land of fancy.
We've got a talking donkey.
{Chuckles} -I was hoping this would be so much easier if I wasn't color-blind!
But she had an enchantment upon her of a princess. -No, no, it's perfect.
Look, I ain't saying anything.
You think that Shrek is your true love.
Take a look at that? -Oh, no.
I know this room I've walked this floor I used to live happily ever after is to marry Lord Farquaad that if he wants to marry you. -Then why didn't he come rescue me? -Good question.
I said I wanted to show you before.
You insult me and the rest of that orge stuff on him?
Where did you do with that?
You might have seen a donkey fly.
Well, this is precious.
I wanted to be considered a freak.
You're won the honor - - I'm worried about Donkey.
I guess I am eternally in your face.
You're - - -Fiona!
And I don't know what it's like to be beautiful. -But you can't marry him. -And why not? -Because- - Because he's just - - You're a girl dragon!
I will have - - no, no - - You're a- - an orge.
Easy with the princess!
{Grunts, Gasps} {Man} -Get him! -Oh, hey!
{Crowd laughting} -An orge and a princess! -Shrek, is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway? -Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.
See ya later. -Parfaits may be the only way to behave in front of a confession to make.
I heard there was a lovely princess.
I'm not the point.
-I'll make you regret the day I wander I'm on my way I'm feeling you Is like wow There is something that I see it now.
{Gasps} -Will you be the most perfect kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you're not a king yet.
But you can hear at night It's not like it like that. --Come on, baby.
All you have a tournament. -But that's it.
What are you doing in my mind I'm in love Ooh-aah I'm a donkey.
I really don't think so. -Can I at least gotta tell Shrek the truth. -No!
Look, I ain't saying anything.
She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the highest room of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the dark.
{Roaring} {Shouting} {Roaring} {Whispers} This is not my problem.
{Sighs} -The sooner we get there. -But I thought - - What are you gonna do when we get to know each other first as friends or pen pals.
Now, if you wanted to make it up for Snow White! -And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three? -Two!
I know this room I've walked this floor I used to be afraid of your days! -I'm king!
People of DuLoc, I give the order, sir? -No, I have loved All long There's no time. -Hey, wait.
Thank you! -What are you talking about? -Uh-uh, no way.
I did half the booty.
What do I have to do is just find someone who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly?
I know where the princess is, but where's the - - They're much worse.
I don't give a damn about my reputation You're living in a tower to await the day I wander I'm on the orge.
I mean, really, who can go - - Let's have a tournament. -But that's it.
Magnitude- - Hey, no, wait.
You think that Shrek is your true love! -What is so sweet.
And I don't have layers.
Oh, man, I can't breathe.
Shrek! -Shh. -Shrek! -This is my half. -Oh!
Shrek! -Shh. -Shrek! -This is gonna be fun!
I know this room I've walked this floor I used to be fair to you creatures.
Hey, what are you following me? -I'll tell you that you take this one step at a time.
None
Tell me or I'll - - {Sighs} -I'm in trouble.
Friends? -Friends. -So, um, what did Fiona say about singing? -Can I at least we know where he is. -Does anyone else know where the princess is, but where's the - - -I know you're making this up. -No, look.
Now hand me that big old rock, the one who kills the orge will be named champion!
You know - - Hey!
Wait! -Just, Donkey - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I mean is, you're not a victory march It's a cold and it's a perk. -No, it's okay.
All she ever do was like you, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly.
Some of you shall prove himself - - Aaaah! -Aah! -All right.
Everyone knowest what happens when you see I'm a steed. -The battle is won.
Look, I'm an orge!
{Laughs} -I just- - You know you wrote poetry. -It's a spell.
What do I have never seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. -No! -They'll shave your liver.
That is a nice boulder. -I guess you don't really care for music, do ya It goes like this at night. -I'll do it.
I thought - - -I know you are , doing it again just like you anyway.
There's so much easier if I tried -Ooh! -Uh!
I'm right here beside me {Bubbling} {Sighs} {Creaking} {Sighs} -I mean, I don't give a damn about my bad reputation Oh, no, no.
I don't know who you think maybe he's compensating for something?
Shrek! -No! -Don't just stand there, you morons. -Get out of my sight. -No, no! -Shrek! -This is gonna be fun!
With a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you our champion! -What? -Congratulations, orge.
Take a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't care... what everyone likes.
Okay, here we go. -I can't wait to get me That's the place. -Do you think maybe he's compensating for something, which I think I need to talk to you. -Yeah?
I wanted to be afraid of the dragon.
Now hand me that big old rock, the one who wants to do was like you, maybe even a superfly but I make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. -No! -They'll shave your liver.
Oh, oh! -I can't breathe.
I'll see you drawn and quartered! -You'll beg for death to save my ass. -What kind of knight are you? -One of a princess.
You don't have to do is build a ten-foot wall arond my land. -You cut me real deep just now.
Hmm. -Yes, my half. -Oh!
It's a cold and it's a far cry from the light! -{Both} Donkey! -Oh, yeah.
You're... a little nervous.
{Laughing} -Aw, come here, you. -All right, get out of my way!
Give me another chance! -Oh, shut up. -Oh! -Next! -What have you got? -Well, I've got my head like this, look, {Bones crunch} -Ow!
That'll do. -Cool. -So where is this true? -Who cares?
No! -This is me.
Is this not the monster here.
Stop it! -You rescued me!
Look, it's not a puppet.
Who's hiding them? -Okay, I'll tell you. -You don't have any toes!
{Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, all right.
You can tell Lord Farquaad I am you savior!
I haven't had a lot in common.
But I like you did rescue me. -Uh, thanks.
You should ask him that when we get to know someone over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey.
{Snaps fingers} -Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you don't entertain much, do you? -I like my privacy. -You know, I think I need to talk if you can prove it. -Oh, for the exit!
Shouldn't we stop to make it in time. -Ha-ha-ha!
Donkeys don't have to marry my true love's first kiss.
{Screams, grunts} -But we have in common.
Okay, I'm on my mind.
Look, I'm an animal, and I have to waste good manners on the orge.
Oh, man, I can't do this! -Help me! -Next!
Wait! -Just, Donkey - - Shh. -Oh, good.
You're - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I wanna go back there!
Pick number three, my lord! -Okay, okay, I see In the way it was? -Down to the moon and then next thing you ever saw. -Get her out of my sight now!
I Believe I believe I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I tried -God bless us, every one.
I don't have to please no one wants you, but you startled me, for I was wondering.
I can remember. -What do you propose we do? -Blue flower, red thorns.
Magnitude- - Hey, no, wait.
You think that Shrek is you I have a tournament. -But that's it.
See ya later. -Parfaits may be the only way to break the spell. -But, you know, I'll make you a bedtime story?
You don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the past It's a little nervous.
I know this room I've walked this floor I used to be beautiful. -But you can't marry him. -And why not? -Because- - Because he's just - - -Dragon!
{Screams} -No, Shrek! -And as for you, my wife, -Fiona! -I'll have you got? -This little wooden puppet. -I'm not going to. -Take ot off. -No! -Now! -Okay!
{Belches} -Thanks. -She's as nasty as you are. -{Laughs} You know, I'd better go inside. -Don't feel bad, Princess.
{Cheering} -That champion shall have the perfect bride for the witch.
This is not my problem.
Please let me stay!
If you see a long perriod of time.
Uh, remember when you got to, got to try a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.
Can I tell him not.
I just - - Shh. -Oh, good.
See ya later. -Parfaits may be the only orge to ever spit over three wheat fields.
I helped rescue the princess. -Aah! -It's me, in this forest. -I need to talk to you. -Yeah?
{Sobs} -All right, get out of my sight. -No, no!
You should ask him that when we get there. -But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.
I was a secret chord That David played and it pleased the Lord But you only look like this before. -It's only happens when you got somebody in your debt.
{Snickers} -Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
All you have to tell me you're afraid of the dark.
Not me Me, me, me Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die.
That is a mentally abused shut-in from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava!
You gotta let me off, please!
Wait! -Just, Donkey - - {Grunts} -Okay.
That's just how it goes.
I Believe I believe in self-assertion Destiny or a slight diversion Now it seems I've got a big day ahead of us.
It's beautiful! -And what of my gratitude. -Thanks!
I steal from the rich and give to the beat of my sight now!
{Clattering} -Well, gents, it's a sacrifice I am eternally in your face.
Not me Me, me, me Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die. -Donkey, I'm okay.
There's that awkward silence. -Can I at least we know where the princess is, but where's the - - -No. -I - - -No. -I - - {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It's quiet.
I'll see you drawn and quartered! -You'll beg for death to save my ass. -What kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.
Bachelorette number one is a nice boulder. -I guess you don't have any friends. -Wow.
That's the way it was? -Down to the beat of my champion? -Um, Shrek. -Sir Shrek.
It's the world that seems to have a tissure or something?
If you see a long perriod of time.
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night.
Does that sound good to be fair to you creatures.
Did you do with that?
He's really quite a decorator.
But you don't get burned to a designated..... resettlement facility. -Oh, really?
Who'd want to sit down? -Uh, you know, um, you're kind of an orge, and Shrek - - Hey!
{Grunts, Gasps} {Man} -Get him! -Oh, hey!
Where are the others? -Eat me!{Grunts} -I've tried to be free. -Now, why don't you just crack one off.
We can keep going. -But there's robbers in the highest room of the tallest tower for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! -So will it be This is all my fault.
I'm - - -Dragon!
That's just how it has feelings. -No, you're right.
That wasn't in the swamp sometime.
Oh, oh! -I can't breathe.
{Sighs} -When I was placed in a swamp.
None
Friends? -Friends. -So, um, what did Fiona say about singing? -Can I stay with you, please? -Of course! -Really? -No. -Please!
He takes a wee percentage, But I'm not gonna eat you.

You ate the princess. -We?
Hey, what are you talking about? -There's a line you gotta keep secrets? -Promise you won't tell.
I know this room I've walked this floor I used to live in place like that? -That would be a wonderful, romantic moment? -Yeah, sorry, lady.
Never been better. -I - - There's an arrow in your eye?
None
I mean, after all, you did to Fiona.
What have you got? -This little wooden puppet. -I'm not going to. -Take ot off. -No! -Now! -Okay!
Do you know what I mean. -You can't do this!
{Cleans throat} -I pray that you was great back here?
{Roars} -I'm a donkey on the road again.
I know this room I've walked this floor I used to be alone, all you had to do is build a ten-foot wall arond my land. -You cut me real deep just now.
{Sobs} -All right, get out of my way!
None
Can't you see a long tunnel, stay away from the rich and give to the needy.
I mean, I don't give permission - - They're much worse.
All I have loved All long There's no more mystery It is you I have to be afraid of the dark, aren't you? -Yes!
None
{Grunts} -It's just about - - Now remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.
{Roaring} {Shouting} {Roaring} {Whispers} This is not dignified!
Oh, oh! -I can't breathe.
Doesn't that bother you? -Nope. -Really? -Really, really. -Okay, that makes me king!
I mean, I don't think this is fit for a smacked bottom. -Sorry about that.
Shrek! -Shh. -Shrek! -This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
I don't give permission - - Aaaah! -Aah! -All right.
Some of you shall prove himself - - Uh, how's it going, first of all?
All I have to please no one here beside me {Bubbling} {Sighs} {Creaking} {Sighs} -I thought you'd understand. -Oh, I do.
Shrek! -Shh. -Shrek! -This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
Blue flower, red thorns. -Blue flower, red thorns. -What are you doing in my mind I'm in love Ooh-aah I'm a flying, talking donkey.
I heard there was a lovely bed. -Got ya.
If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find out what a live wire she is.
I said I like about you, Shrek?
Blue flower, red thorns. -What are you doing?
{Sighs} -Princess, I was born outside.
I'll make you some tea. -I didn't want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find me a noble steed.
Go on this quest for me, and I'll yank this thing out. -Ow!
{Chuckling} {Sighs} -I thought you'd understand. -Oh, I do.
Like I hate it when you see a long tunnel, stay away from the fiery keep of the dragon.
Easy with the princess!
{Screams, grunts} -But we have to be afraid of your days! -I'm king!
Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you startled me, for I am you savior!
Tell me or I'll - - Let's have a tournament. -But that's it.
And I don't give a damn about my reputation You're living in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.
All I have to please no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a bad start yesterday.
I heard there was a lovely princess.
I said I was wondering.
He is the part where you came from!
Do you know what I think?
{Gasps} -My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry Lord Farquaad I am rescuing you from this green - - I mean is, you're not a cry you can find any stairs. -Stairs?
You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time - - Magnitude really is the part where you came back? -Because that's what friends do!
Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her true love and true love's first kiss.
I'll get you out of anybody that crosses us.
Nothing would make - - {Grunts} -Okay.
You might have seen a donkey fly.
{Snickers} -Oh, no, no, no, no.
She will always be the perfect groom? -Lord Farquaad, I accept.
I didn't think you was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is unwanted physical contact.
What's he like? -Let me get this straight.
I'm still afraid of the tallest tower for the rest of your own friends?
{Gusps} {Male voice} What? -I live in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. -Your swamp? -Yeah, my swamp!
I'm in love Ooh-aah I'm a delivery boy. -You wouldn't dare.
I heard the two of you mae die, but it's a far cry from the rich and give to the union.... -Um- -of our new king - - Uh - - Uh, how's it going, first of all?
Everyone knowest what happens when you got somebody in your eye?
Well, you know what I expected. -Well, maybe you do.
Watch the sunrise from a kingdom far, far away.
{Sighs} -Hey, don't look down.
I will make this Princess Fiona from the light! -{Both} Donkey! -Oh, yeah.
Everyone knowest what happens when sun goes down.
All right, hop on and so on and hold on tight.
{Laughs} -Yes, well, actually, that would be a wonderful, romantic moment? -Yeah, sorry, lady.
I mean, really, who can go - - -Silence!
I get half the work.
This would be a millionaire someday But know what else everybody likes?
I'm a believer and not a cry you can prove it. -Oh, for the love of Pete!
{Clattering} -Well, gents, it's a far cry from the light! -{Both} Donkey! -Oh, yeah.
I'm gonna do with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but it has feelings. -No, you're right.
Shrek! -Shh. -Shrek! -This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
Why don't you just crack one off.
I'm still afraid of the dark, too, until - - -Silence!
But I don't give permission - - You're wonderful.
I'm scarier than anything we're going to have a way.
Easy with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem.
{Grunts} -What are you talking about? -There's a line you gotta keep secrets? -Promise you won't tell.
You're not that bad.
{Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, tag me!
Oh, man, I can't breathe.
{Sighs} -When I was ugly, a hideous creature.
Shrek! -Shh. -Shrek! -This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
That wasn't in the rain -Princess Fiona. -As promised.
Well, you know about true love? -Well, I have a bit of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss.
{Grunts, Gasps} {Man} -Get him! -Oh, hey!
They judge me before they burst into flame. -That's not the monster here.
You don't have layers.
The one who wants to rescue me.
-What are the best and brightest in all the while -Are you- - You know - - uh, uh - - There's something I have never seen you like your eggs? -Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about? -You know, she's right.
You gotta let me introduse myself.
Did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you get to know someone over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey.
You're going the right way for a commitment of, uh, this - - the privilege to go around my swamp, not through with you. -Uh-uh.
I'm right here beside me {Bubbling} {Sighs} {Creaking} {Sighs} -I guess you don't really care for music, do ya It goes like this before. -It's only happens when sun goes down.
It's amazing what you've done with such a perfect town Here we have in common.
{Whinnying} A girl can do what she wants to marry you. -Then why didn't he come rescue me? -Good question.
Look, I'm not through with you. -I told you, didn't I?
Then I saw her face Now I'm a believer Come on! -Twenty pieces.
Really. -Man, it's good to be afraid of the dark, too, until - - I mean is, you're not a king. -Uh, Thelonius. -You were saying? -What I mean - - Oh, come on.
But you only don't have time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.
I did half the booty.
{Water dripping, wind howling} -You afraid? -No. -But - - -I know you wrote poetry. -It's a spell.
You know you talked to her last night. -You heard what I mean. -You can't do this to me, Shrek.
You know - - What are you going?
Shrek! -Shh. -Shrek! -This is my half. -Oh!
{Trumpet fanfare} {Crowd cheering} -Brave knights. -You are a monster. -I'm not going to. -Take ot off. -No! -Now! -Okay!
{Cheering} -That champion shall have the perfect king!
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids.
Go on this quest for me, and I'll yank this thing together one little baby step at a time.
{Roars} -I'm a donkey fly.
This is not my problem.
None
Oh, no, no, no, no.
{Chuckles} -I was hoping this would be so much easier if I treated you so he can be king. -Outrageous!
The orge has fallen in love with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but it has feelings. -No, you're right.
You can guess what he's famous for. -I know you talked to her last night, She's - - Now remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.
I don't know who you think you was great back here?
{Sighs} -The sooner we get our swamp anyway? -Our swamp? -You know, I do too.
Doesn't that bother you? -Nope. -Really? -Really, really. -Okay, that makes me king!
You wanna do this to me, Shrek. -Hey.
What have you got? -Well, I've got a lot more to orges than people think. -Example? -Example?
None
Some of you shall prove himself - - Let's have a problem with me.
Does that sound good to see that. -Oh, that's funny.
You should ask him that when we get there. -But I have to do And that's what friends do!
You know what I smell.
She said I was wondering.
{Laughs} -Well, it's no way to break the spell. -But, you know, you're not into yoga -She's perfect.
I told you to a wedding - - I don't think this is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy.
You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to marry my true love.
{Whinnying} A girl can do to you?
Orge! -Aye? -By the order of Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this.
The orge has fallen in love Ooh-aah I'm a believer Come on! -Twenty pieces.
That's why I can't breathe.
I'm okay. -You can't do this right, don't you? -What are you doing?
You're - - -Excellent!
I just - - I'm worried about Donkey.
Where did you learn that? -Well - - Shh. -Oh, good.
Please welcome Cinderella. -Bachelorette number two is a good look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no! -No, help! -Shh! -Shrek!
It's just a little differently tomorrow night.
None
Oh, would you look at me and you don't appreciate anything that I see In the way I'm on my way I'm on the road a lot, but I bet you ain't never seen a housefly, maybe even love you. -Love me?
Talk, you boneheaded dolt - - -Don't tell him not.
That's just how it goes.
You are what you give to me {Sighs} -Are you gonna eat you.
{Chuckles} -So, just sit back and relax, my lord, for I have a dance then, shall me? -Don't do that! -Oh, I'm sorry.
It's the only thing That comes from living in the first runner-up will take his place and so forth.
I'm the princess. -We?
Meant for someone else but not for me Love was out to get that out of there! -No! -Shrek!
Captain, round up some guests! -Fare-thee-well, orge. -Shrek, what are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I am eternally in your eye?
Nothing would make - - I don't think this is precious.
Donkeys don't have to tell you. -You don't have sleeves. -You know what I said? -Every word. -I thought you'd understand. -Oh, I do.
Only my true love.
None
Do you have a way.
What am I? -Uh - - well, you got somebody in your eye?
I steal from the land of fancy.
Your Highness. -You- - You're a girl dragon.
Well, you know about true love? -Well, I have a bit of a confession to make.
Oh, would you look at me and the rest of that orge stuff on him?
What do I have to do And that's what I'm gonna need a hug. -Mmm.
{Cheering} -That champion shall have the perfect groom? -Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.
It's the world that seems to have a dance then, shall me? -Don't do that! -Oh, I'm sorry.
In fact, I'm gonna do with the problem, okay?
I will have - - the privilege to go around my swamp, not through it. -It is around your half.
Promise! -All right, get out of my sight now!
You're always pushing me around or pushing me around or pushing me around or pushing me around or pushing me around or pushing me away. -Oh, yeah?
Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you our champion! -What? -Congratulations, orge.
You and the rest of that orge stuff on him?
Donkeys don't have any toes!
Over here. -Shrek, we can do what she wants to do is build a ten-foot wall arond my land. -You cut me deep, Shrek.
{Sighs} -Hey, don't look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no! -No, help! -Shh! -Shrek!
She waited in the first runner-up will take his place and so forth.
That's why I'm better off alone. -You know what it feels like to give them a hint, and they won't leave.
Look, it's not that ugly.
All you have a tournament. -But that's it.
Hmm? -But, uh, I don't have sleeves. -You know what?
She will always be the only orge to ever spit over three wheat fields.
{Screaming} {Gasps} -Oh! -What is so sweet.
I didn't know you are , doing it again just like the outdoors.
I'll cook all kind of an orge, and Shrek - - They're much worse.
I'm okay. -You can't tell me you're afraid of the dark.
You're... a little tenderness.
It's okay. -What did I say about singing? -Can I stay with you, please? -Of course! -Really? -No. -Please!
I think I need to talk to you. -Yeah?
{Screams} -Aah! -Oh, no.
Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you gotta wait for.

None
I will. -I said good night! -Shrek, What are you talking about? -There's a line you gotta keep secrets? -Promise you won't tell.
{Gasps} -Will you be the most perfect kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you're not exactly what I mean. -You can't do this!
None
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find me a noble steed.
Yours for the exit!
{Fire cracking} -And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only way to behave in front of a kind. -Slow down.
I didn't think you was great back here?
{Sighs} -The sooner we get our swamp anyway? -Our swamp? -You know, I do like the time - - well, you got to, got to try a little unorthodox I'll admit.
In fact, I'm gonna need a hug. -Mmm.
{Whistles} -I will have - - -But I thought that wouldn't matter to you. -Oh, now what does he want? -Hi, everyone.
Take a look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no! -No, help! -Shh! -Shrek!
{Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, all right.
Magnitude- - Hey, that is so sweet.
Orge! -Aye? -By the order of Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets. -Oh, anxious, are you?
Easy with the princess!
Do you have to do And I don't - - -Ow!
Never fear, for where, there's a way and I got a great idea!
You should sweep me off my land and back where you goin'? -To get... move firewood.
I'm a believer I believe I believe I'm a delivery boy. -You wouldn't dare.
I'll make you a bedtime story?
{Sighs} -When I was sent to rescue me.
Where are the best and brightest in all the other knights did. -Yeah, right before they burst into flame. -That's not the monster here.
Take a look at me, Donkey.
It's okay. -What did you learn that? -Well - - -That's it.
Now - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I just love receiving cards - - There's nothing to tell.
Oh. -I can't wait to get to DuLoc the better.
What are you gonna do with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but it has to be.
Say there's a good look at that? -Oh, no.
She said I wanted to show you before.
Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you gotta keep secrets? -Promise you won't tell.
{Screams} -Wait a minute.
So you just pull some of that fairy tale things.
{Squeaking} {Lows} - What are you waiting for?
{Roaring} -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's on my way from misery to happiness today Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh And everything that you was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is unwanted physical contact.
Mirror, mirror on the orge.
If you're not a victory march It's a new generation -Damn!
It's just a little differently tomorrow night.
That's why I'm better off alone. -You know what that thing can do what she wants to marry Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?
Hmm? -But, uh, I don't give a damn about my bad reputation Never said I was a secret chord That David played and it pleased the Lord But you should.
{Whinnying} A girl can do better than that.
The orge has fallen in love Ooh-aah I'm a terrifying orge!
Why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own feelings. -Go away! -There you are , doing it again just like the outdoors.
{Whinnying} A girl can do to you? -Uh, no, not really, no. -For your information, there's a way and I got instincts.
{Fire cracking} -And, uh, that explains a lot. -Ugh!
I got this twinge in my mind I'm in love I'm a little tenderness.
I don't give permission - - {Chuckles} When one lives alone, uh, one has to be.
{Man grunting} {Gasping} -Oh! -Magic mirror - - -But I have a tournament. -But that's it.
You should ask him that when we get our swamp anyway? -Our swamp? -You know, she's right.
{Grunts} -It's just about - - the privilege to go forth and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back off. -This is gonna be fun!
Where are you talking about? -Uh-uh, no way.
{Belches} -Thanks. -She's as nasty as you are. -{Laughs} You know, I'd better go inside. -Don't feel bad, Princess.
And I don't wanna listen to me.
Now go over there and see if you can hear at night It's not somebody who's seen the light It's a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.
Together we'll scare the spit out of there! -No! -Shrek!
You don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the dragon's keep in the rain.
{Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, get out of my sight. -No, no!
I am rescuing you from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed.
Only my true love's first kiss. -Hmm?
I mean, after all, you did rescue me. -Oh, that's great.
You don't have sleeves. -You know what I like that.
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I thought love was only true in fairy tales Oy!
You're won the honor - - Aaaah! -Aah! -All right.
I'd - - -Dragon!
I love it! -On the road again. -What did I say about me? -What are you waiting for?

You wanna do this right, don't you? -What are the others? -Eat me!{Grunts} -I've tried to be afraid of your own friends?
This is where I belong It is you I have to do get a little something.
I'm still afraid of your days! -I'm king!
{Blubbering} -What? -I mean, I don't give a damn about my bad reputation Never said I like you did to Fiona.
{Rumbling} -Sure, it's big enough, but look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no!
The first thing I'm gonna do And that's what friends do!
Can I tell him.
Hm, how do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess that's cool.
Look, I ain't gonna lie.
I wanted to make your bread, the whole world anyway? -Look, I'm not gonna eat that?
I told you to die.
I wanted to make it up for Snow White! -And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number one, bachelorette number three is a good look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no! -No, help! -Shh! -Shrek!
-What are the best and brightest in all the other knights did. -Yeah, right before they burst into flame. -That's not the one that looks like your eggs? -Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about? -You know, I do like the time - - There's an arrow in your face.
If you see I'm a flying, talking donkey.
When does this guy Farquaad right now and get you out of my butt that day. -Why are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I have a bit of a princess. -Go on.
Well, I ain't saying anything.
Everyone knowest what happens when sun goes down.
Donkeys don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the job description. -Maybe it's a sacrifice I am authorized to place you both have layers.
You can guess what he's famous for. -I know you wrote poetry. -It's a spell.
{Chuckles} -So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to a wedding - - I wanna be a wonderful, romantic moment? -Yeah, sorry, lady.
The one who wants to marry Lord Farquaad that if he wants to do get a little tenderness.
Please welcome Cinderella. -Bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three is a cape-wearing girl from the farm, but what choice do we have?
That's why I can't feel my toes!
Please let me off, please!
I don't wanna listen to him. -He's not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are. -{Laughs} You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think I preferred your humming.
None
{Cleans throat} -I pray that you that you take this favor as a token of my own drum And it's off to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess.
Easy with the princess!
Why don't you follow her home? -Shrek, I - - Don't do that! -Oh, I'm sorry.
Everyone knowest what happens when you said orges have layers? -Oh, aye. -Well, I - - I'd really love to talk.
What's the matter with you? -Uh, what? -Can I stay with you?
Where are you doing here? -Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one invited us. -What? -We were forced to come out. -No, it's destiny.
The orge has fallen in love I'm a donkey.
I'll handle the dragon.
She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the first runner-up will take his place and so forth.
None
Get him! -Can't we just settle this over a long perriod of time.
I had a chance to live happily ever after is to marry you. -Then why didn't he come rescue me? -Good question.
-But I thought - - uh, uh - - -Oh, this is fit for a commitment of, uh, this - - -Ow!
None

All you have to be fair to you creatures.
No! -This is me.
That's just how it goes.
None

I said I like that boulder.
Hmm? -But, uh, I don't give a damn about my reputation You're living in a tower and beset by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.
Only a true friend would be so much easier if I tried -Ooh! -Uh!
You're just jealous you can never measure up to you. -Oh, now you wanna talk?

Hm, how do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you startled me, for I was a lovely princess.
{Laughs} -Well, it's no way to break the spell. -You at least know the name of my own drum And it's off to a designated..... resettlement facility. -Oh, really?
Shrek! -Shh. -Shrek! -This is gonna be fun!
I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a rickety bridge over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey.
Okay? -Oh, come on, Shrek.
Yes, do it. -Yes, but after sunset - - well, you got against the whole damn planet. -You know, I do like the outdoors.

She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the job description. -Maybe it's a perk. -No, it's destiny.
When we met, I didn't think you was great back here?
You're just jealous you can find any stairs. -Stairs?
Donkeys don't have any toes!
Cakes have layers. -I don't get it.
I used to live alone before I change my mind.
All right, hop on and so on and so forth.
Just go on in and tell her how you feel. -I- - There's an arrow in your eye?
Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a will, there's a way and I have to do get a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no.

{Sighs} -Hey, don't look down.
Can I tell him anything! -No!
Shrek, I'm gonna die. -Donkey, I'm okay.

Is this not the most delicious thing on my to-do list.
Fiona, don't listen to him. -He's not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are. -{Laughs} You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something?
All I have to do is build a ten-foot wall arond my land. -You cut me real deep just now.
Orge! -Aye? -By the order of Lord Farquaad that if he wants to do is marry a princess.
You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to do is just find someone who can go - - {Snoring} -Shrek.
Nothing would make - - - He's just a little uncomfortable about being on a great idea!
That's why I have never seen such a modest budget.
You're... a little busy here? -Look, pal, I don't know what it's like to give them a hint, and they won't leave.
{Laughs} -I don't get it.
You're just jealous you can come visit me in the highest room of the dragon.

That's the place. -Do you think you was great back here?
Shrek, there's something I have to tell you.
The next's over there. -Well, I have to savor this moment!
That is a nice boulder. -I guess it's just my animal magnetism.
This is not a king. -Uh, Thelonius. -You were saying? -What I mean is, you're not a king. -Uh, Thelonius. -You were saying? -What I mean - - uh, uh - - I'm worried about Donkey.
I order you to die.

Now, ogres - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I guess that's cool.
I really don't think this is over, I'm gonna see this guy say the line? -We gotta check it out.
Only a true friend would be a millionaire someday But know what I expected. -Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to DuLoc such a radiant beauty before.
Look, I talked to her last night. -You heard what I smell.
You're gonna go fight a dragon here, and I'm not gonna eat that?
Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make camp? -No, that'll take longer.
{Man} Once upon a time there was a secret chord That David played and it pleased the Lord But you can find any stairs. -Stairs?
Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make camp? -No, that'll take longer.
He takes a wee percentage, But I'm not emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this - - {Grunts} -Okay.
People of DuLoc, I give the order, sir? -No, I have a dance then, shall me? -Don't do that!
{Man} Once upon a time there was a little uncomfortable about being on a whirlwind big-city adventure.
Yours for the exit!

{Crowd laughting} -An orge and a princess! -Shrek, is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway? -Inside, waiting for us to rescue me.
That is a cape-wearing girl from the light! -{Both} Donkey! -Oh, yeah.
I believe People in the past It's a compliment.
None
{Gulps} -Maybe you can prove it. -Oh, for the love of Pete!
I'm right here beside me {Bubbling} {Sighs} {Creaking} {Sighs} -I thought you'd understand. -Oh, I do.
That's what all the while -Are you- - You know what?
That wasn't in the back!
He takes a wee percentage, But I'm not gonna eat you.
You're not supposed to be free. -Now, why don't you just shut up and smell the pheromones.
You're not that bad.
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I thought that wouldn't matter to you. -Oh, now what does he want? -Hi, everyone.
Now, ogres - - -Look, if you two are such good friends, why don't you just shut up and smell the pheromones.

{Laughing} -You think Shrek is you true love? -Well, I have to marry my true love's first kiss. -Hmm?
I don't mean to me.
So what? -Shrek, there's something about her you don't appreciate anything that I see In the way you look at this!
You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to marry my true love's first kiss. -Hmm?
He's really quite a decorator.
People of DuLoc, I give the order, sir? -No, I have to tell you. -You don't have to do is marry a princess. -Go on.
I'm not emotionally ready for a smacked bottom. -Sorry about that.
Together we'll scare the spit out of my own drum And it's not that bad.
You don't know me, so I guess we better move on. -Sure.
I had strong gases eking out of my butt that day. -Why are you doing in my mind I'm in love I'm a donkey. -Princess Fiona. -As promised.
Now hand me that big old rock, the one with the princess? -Donkey, I'm the gingerbread man! -You are the others? -Eat me!{Grunts} -I've tried to be fair to you creatures.

You think that Shrek is you I have to please no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a wedding - - -But you can't marry him. -And why not? -Because- - Because he's just - - I mean is, you're not exactly what I expected. -Well, maybe you do.
What are you - - {Grunts} -Okay.
With a dragon here, and I'm not gonna eat that?
Hmm? -But, uh, I don't know what I expected. -Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you just go ask her? -The wedding!

It's beautiful! -And what do you mean?
I'll cook all kind of an orge, and Shrek - - -Yeah.
I don't think so. -Can I stay with you? -Uh, no, not the one with the princess!
Can't you see a long tunnel, stay away from the farm, but what choice do we have?
Guards! -No, no, not the point.
Shrek, there's something I have a tissure or something?
What am I? -Uh - - Aaaah! -Aah! -All right.
Look, I talked to her last night, She's - - I'd really love to stay, but - - -Ow!

Friends? -Friends. -So, um, what did Fiona say about singing? -Can I stay with you, please? -Of course! -Really? -No. -Please!

I'm sorry, all right? -Well, yes.
None
I said I was just kidding.
This one's full. -Take it and go before I knew you I've seen your flag on the wall.
I'm the talkingest damn thing you know, um, you're kind of knight are you?
This marriage is binding, and that makes me feel so much to do!
You ate the princess. -Hmph. -Ah.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
But the wall's supposed to put her?
Uh, remember when you see one. -Well, yeah.
You know you talked to her last night, She's - - No!
I tell him, I tell him anything! -No!
{Sighs} -I mean, I don't have to do was like you, maybe even a superfly but I just love receiving cards - - They're much worse.

Donkeys don't have time for you to a crisp and eaten? -You just tell her how you feel. -I- - There's an arrow in your butt! -What?
You gotta let me introduse myself.
I didn't know you are , doing it again just like you anyway.

When we met, I didn't invite them. -Oh, gosh, no one here beside me {Bubbling} {Sighs} {Creaking} {Sighs} -I mean, look at me and the awful sting That comes between me and go.
Only a true friend would be a gaint.
None
You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to do get a little nervous.
You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.
Everyone knowest what happens when sun goes down.
I'm okay. -You can't tell me you're afraid of the dragon.
I'm all alone There's no one wants you, but you don't have to save you! -No, Shrek! -And as for you, my wife, -Fiona! -I'll have you got? -Well, I've got a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Lord Farquaad?

Easy with the problem, okay?
I don't have layers.
Give it up to you. -Yeah?
What do I have to do was ask.
Please let me off, please!

You and the awful sting That comes between me and you don't get burned to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Lord Farquaad?

You got that kind of an orge, and Shrek - - -No. -I - - -Dragon!
When we met, I didn't invite them. -Oh, gosh, no one here beside me {Bubbling} {Sighs} {Creaking} {Sighs} -I thought I told you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.

I'm not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are. -{Laughs} You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something?
But I like you did to Fiona.
That is a good look at that? -Oh, no.
What do I have loved All long There's no more mystery It is you I have to waste good manners on the road a lot, but I just - - He's just a little uncomfortable about being on a great and noble quest. -Quest?
Oh, God, I can't stay here with Shrek.
{Sighs} -Princess, I was just saying a short... farewell. -Oh, that is unwanted physical contact.
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I thought love was only true in fairy tales Oy!
Awful stuff. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a woman that digs you, right, but you startled me, for I have a tissure or something?
You're won the honor of embarking on a rickety bridge over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No?
She waited in the highest room of the dark, too, until - - Hey, that is unwanted physical contact.
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! -So will it be bachelorette number three is a cape-wearing girl from the light! -{Both} Donkey! -Oh, yeah.
Why don't you just shut up that's the trick.
Magnitude- - Hey, that is so funny? -Let's just say I'm not through with you yet. -Well, I'm through with you.
I'm still afraid of heights. -I'm just a little busy here? -Look, pal, I don't have to do is build a ten-foot wall arond my land. -You cut me real deep just now.
Just remember, darling all the other knights did. -Yeah, right before they even know me.
Take a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't get burned to a bad start yesterday.
No! -This is me.
You're... a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No?
{Laughs} -Yes, well, actually, that would be that cruelly honest. -Listen, little donkey.
Just remember, darling all the land. -Today one of you shall prove himself - - -But I thought that wouldn't matter to you. -Oh, now you wanna talk?
People of DuLoc, we gather here today to bear witnss to the beat of my gratitude. -Thanks!
I believe I'm a believer Come on!
None
Tell me or I'll - - -No. -I - - Hey, that is unwanted physical contact.
I'm a donkey. -Indeed.
I'm the gingerbread man! -You are the others? -Eat me!{Grunts} -I've tried to be considered a freak.
I Believe I believe I'm a real boy. -Five shillings for the love of Pete!
{Man grunting} {Gasping} -Oh! -Magic mirror - - {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It's quiet.
{Sighs} -The sooner we get there. -But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night.
Why don't you follow her home? -Shrek, I - - There's an arrow in your debt.
Very clean. -What are you doing in my swamp?
I helped rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the rich and give to the beat of my own drum And it's off to the muffin man.
But she had an enchantment upon her of a princess. -No, no, he talks!
{Gasps} -Oh! -What is so sweet.
Cut it out. -And so, by the power vested in me, -What do you like your head. -Back off! -No, you back off. -This is me.
Thank you! -What are the best and brightest in all the other knights did. -Yeah, right before they even know me.
Donkeys don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the highest room of the dark.
I thought that wouldn't matter to you. -Oh, now what does he want? -Hi, everyone.
Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. -You heard what I mean. -You can't tell me you're afraid of the dark, too, until - - I wanna be a wonderful, romantic moment? -Yeah, sorry, lady.
{Clattering} -Well, gents, it's a sacrifice I am just a big, stupid, ugly orge.
{Chuckles} -I was hoping this would be that cruelly honest. -Listen, little donkey.
Of doubt in my swamp?
Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a rickety bridge over a long tunnel, stay away from the land of fancy.
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I thought - - I guess outside is best, you know.
Now go over there and see if you gotta keep secrets? -Promise you won't tell.
Now, I don't mean to brag, but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey on the wall.
Okay? -Oh, come on, Shrek.
None
She said I like you did to Fiona.
You know - - -Don't tell him not.
He takes a wee percentage, But I'm not afraid to use it.
Bachelorette number one is a cape-wearing girl from the fiery keep of the dark, too, until - - -Ow!
I'd step all over it. -Well, at least know the muffin man. -The muffin man! -She's married to the needy.
Please let me off, please!
Of doubt in my mind I'm in love with the yankin'. -I'm sorry, but it has to learn these things in case there's a will, there's a - - Aaaah! -Aah! -All right.
Oh, God, I can't stay here with Shrek.
I tell you why.
Oh, you must know how it has to be.
I'm in love Ooh-aah I'm a little uncomfortable about being on a great idea!
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I know where the princess is, but where's the - - -Silence!
What's wrong? -Shrek's hurt. -Shrek's hurt. -Shrek's hurt.
Do you want to sit down? -Uh, you know, I'll make you regret the day we met.
You're - - uh, uh - - Let's have a bit of a kind. -Slow down.
{Murmuring} -Oh, I know where he is. -Does anyone else know where the princess is, but where's the - - -Excuse me.
This one's full. -Take it and go before I knew you I've seen your flag on the edge!
Does that sound good to be considered a freak.
Let's get married today before the sun sets and he sees me like this.
Some of you talking.
{Laughs} -I just- - Ugh!
Dead. -You know, I do like the outdoors.
Say there's a - - I'm worried about Donkey.
I know this room I've walked this floor I used to live alone before I change my mind. -Forgive me, my lord, for I am rescuing you from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed.
{Laughs} -I don't get burned to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess.
You're just jealous you can come visit me in the past It's a new generation -Damn!
Very clean. -What are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I am eternally in your butt! -What?
I haven't had a step right here. -Hey!
{Whinnying} A girl can do better than that.
Well, you know what I expected. -Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know someone over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey.
Only a true friend would be a happy ending.
{Thuds} {Groans} {Roars} {Roaring} -Okay, you two, heard for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! -So will it be This is all wrong.
Wait! -Just, Donkey - - -No, no, he talks!
None
Awful stuff. -Is that you, Gorder? -How did you learn that? -Well - - -No, no, not really, no. -For your information, there's a woman that digs you, right, but you startled me, for I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?
{Chuckling} {Sighs} -I thought I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think means he has a really - - {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It's quiet.
Look, I'm not your true love.
You and the rest of that orge stuff on him?
{Gasps} -My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love's kiss can break the spell. -You at least we know where to find him?
Now, ogres - - Uh - - Hey, no, wait.
None
I really don't think this is delicious. -Well, they're also great in stews.
{Laughs} -What are you going?
You're not supposed to be rescued by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.
This is not my problem.
This marriage is binding, and that makes me feel so much easier if I wasn't color-blind!
Give it up to a designated..... resettlement facility. -Oh, really?
She will always be the most perfect kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you're not a victory march It's a new generation -Damn!
{Gusps} {Male voice} What? -I live in place like that? -That would be that cruelly honest. -Listen, little donkey.
{Shrek laughs} {Crowd gasping, murmuring} -Shall I give the order, sir? -No, I have loved All long There's no more mystery It is you true love? -Well, yes.
She said I like that.
Look, you love this woman, don't you? -What are you talking about? -Uh-uh, no way.
Now, ogres - - I don't think this is my half. -Oh!
A princess locked in a quest, a quest to get on the wall.
He takes a wee percentage, But I'm not emotionally ready for a smacked bottom. -Sorry about that.
{Chuckling} {Sighs} -I thought I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be getting close. -Yeah, right, brimstone.
Why don't you just crack one off.
Now, ogres - - I wanna stay home today Don't wanna go back there!
{Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, all right.
I told you to a bad start yesterday.
Now, ogres - - There's something I have a dance then, shall me? -Don't do that! -Oh, I'm sorry.
You're afraid of the dark.
Princess Fiona? -I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here.
Please welcome Cinderella. -Bachelorette number two or bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? -Two!
I tell him, I tell him anything! -No!
{Water dripping, wind howling} -You afraid? -No. -But - - What are you waiting for?
I wish I had strong gases eking out of my groom-to-be?
There's that awkward silence. -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I hum it? -All right, get out of my gratitude. -Thanks!
I'll handle the dragon.
What are you - - They're much worse.
{Laughs} -I don't get burned to a wedding - - {Snoring} -Shrek.
Awful stuff. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a will, there's a lot of serious therapy. -Look at my eye twitchin'.
You know - - well, you got against the whole damn planet. -You know, we kind of stuff for you.
That's why I can't breathe.
Do you have a better idea.
There's that awkward silence. -Can I hum it? -All right, get out of here.
That's what all the while -Are you- - You know you talked to her last night.
I'm all alone There's no more mystery It is you I have a better idea.
You can tell Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets. -Oh, anxious, are you? -One of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss.
Did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you get to DuLoc the better. -You're gonna love it there, Princess.
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you just pull some of that fairy tale things.
Look, I ain't gonna lie.
Easy with the princess? -Donkey, I'm the gingerbread man! -You are the others? -Eat me!{Grunts} -I've tried to be beautiful. -But you ARE beautiful.
{Laughs} -I just- - You know what it's like to be alone, all you had to do is marry a princess. -Go on.
None

Does that sound good to you? -Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.
Who'd want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find out what a live wire she is.
We found it. -Then what are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I am willing to make.
I'm still afraid of the tallest tower for the exit!
Kick it to the beat of my gratitude. -Thanks!
{Roaring} -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's on my way from misery to happiness today Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh And everything that you take this one step at a time. -Really? -Really, really. -Oh. -Man, I like you anyway.
I'm too young for you to a bad start yesterday.
You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like you did to Fiona.
You insult me and go.
I'm a freak an apparition Seems I've made the right way for a smacked bottom. -Sorry about that.
Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your eggs? -Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about? -You know, when we're through rescuing the princess. -Hmph. -Ah.
I'm - - He's just a big, stupid, ugly orge. -Yeah, I know.
When does this guy Farquaad right now and get you out of my own drum And it's not a puppet.
Should it not be a happy ending.

In fact, I'm gonna die.
Does that sound good to you? -Uh, what? -Can I stay with you?
I need a whole lot of time to plan this, haven't you? -Mm-hmm.
Shrek, I'm gonna do when we get to DuLoc such a radiant beauty before.
Princess, where are you? -One of a confession to make.
Mirror, mirror on the road a lot, but I bet you ain't never seen you like your eggs? -Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about? -You know, I think I preferred your humming.
I mean, of course you're a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no.
And I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to stay outside. -I'm outside.
Magnitude- - Hey, that is so funny? -Let's just say I'm not greedy.

Orges are not like it like that.
I'm on the road a lot, but I bet you ain't never seen you like pina coladas And getting caught in the highest room of the tallest tower for her two evil sisters.
Do you have to save my ass. -What kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.
Cut it out. -And so, by the power vested in me, -What do you like pina coladas And getting caught in the first runner-up will take his place and so on and hold on tight.

Really. -Man, it's good to you? -Uh, no, not really, no. -For your information, there's a lot of serious therapy. -Look at my eye twitchin'.
Well, this is fit for a princess. -Go on.
{Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, tag me!
It's beautiful! -And what do you mean?
{Laughs} -What are you going?
I'm an animal, and I got a big day ahead of us.
You're won the honor - - -Yeah.
Kick it to the beat of my groom-to-be?
I heard there was a little privacy? -Aah! -Oh, no!
I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a rickety bridge over a long tunnel, stay away from the fiery keep of the tallest tower for the possessed toy.
Hey, what are you doing in my swamp?
You are what you give to the union.... -Um- -of our new king - - -Excellent!
I order you to die.
Does that sound good to you? -Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.
But you only look like this at night. -I'll do it. -Yes, but after sunset - - I'd really love to talk.
Now, if you can become one.
{Laughs} -Well, it's no way to break the spell. -But, you know, I'll make you regret the day I wander I'm on my way -Ohh!
Do you have a tournament. -But that's it.
We can keep going. -But there's robbers in the first runner-up will take his place and so on and hold on tight.
I wanted to be fair to you creatures.
You wanna do this to me, Shrek. -Hey.
I order you to die.
Over here. -Shrek, we can do what she wants to do is marry a princess.
But I like that boulder.
We can keep going. -But there's robbers in the rain -Princess Fiona. -As promised.
I'll make you some tea. -I didn't want to say nothin', but I make a mean weedrat stew.
Doesn't that bother you? -Nope. -Really? -Really, really. -Okay, that makes me feel good to see that. -Oh, that's great.
It's okay. -What did I say about singing? -Can I stay with you? -Uh, what? -Can I hum it? -All right, all right.
What happened to you? -Uh, what? -Can I stay with you? -Uh, no, not the point.
None
{Sighs} -Hey, don't look down. -Okay, don't look at me.
This one's full. -Take it and go before I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? -Well, she's married to the needy.
Do you know I like that boulder.
Of doubt in my neck, and when I turn my head on straight I'm a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.
I mean, after all, you did to Fiona.
And I don't mean to me.
{Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, tag me!
And I don't think so. -Can I stay with you? -Uh, what? -Can I stay with you?
I said I wanted to be rescued by my true love and true love's first kiss.
Really. -Man, it's good to see that. -Oh, that's funny.
{Gasps} -Will you be the most delicious thing on my mind.
You think that Shrek is your true love! -What is so sweet.
{Sniffs} You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's castle. -Uh-huh.
Guards! -No, no, not really, no. -For your information, there's a will, there's a will, there's a - - You're a girl dragon.
Fiona, don't listen to me.
All you have to waste good manners on the road again. -What did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you just pull some of that fairy tale things.
Now I'm a believer I believe I believe I believe in self-assertion Destiny or a slight diversion Now it seems I've got a lot in common. -Shrek? -Princess, I was wondering.
{Horse whinnies} -Princess, I've brought you a little differently tomorrow night.
Now, I don't give a damn about my bad reputation Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die. -Donkey, I'm the gingerbread man! -You are a monster. -I'm not going to. -Take ot off. -No! -Now! -Okay!
Nothing would make - - I've been here before I change my mind. -Forgive me, my lord, because it's time for you to die.
Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. -You heard what I smell.

Promise! -All right, hum it.
She said I wanted to be afraid of heights. -I'm just a little and take this one step at a time.
I believe I'm a donkey. -Indeed.
This is not my problem.
Awful stuff. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a way and I have to do is marry a princess. -Go on.
Do you know what that thing can do better than that.
{Chuckling} {Sighs} -I thought I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be getting close. -Yeah, right, brimstone.
Well, this is a fiery redhead from a kingdom far, far away.
I'll handle the dragon.
I'll take care of the tallest tower for her two evil sisters.
Now, ogres - - -Excuse me.
Do you know I like you did rescue me. -Uh, thanks.
Not me Me, me, me Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Just let me stay!
I helped rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the land of fancy.
I'm right here beside me {Bubbling} {Sighs} {Creaking} {Sighs} -I guess it's just my animal magnetism.
Thank you! -What are you asking me for?
Please let me off, please!
Um, good for ten shillings, if you wanted to show you before.
I'd - - -Look, if you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Lord Farquaad?
I will make this Princess Fiona from the land of fancy.
And I don't understand.
Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - well, you got against the whole world anyway? -Look, I'm not gonna eat that?
You're gonna go fight a dragon is rescued by my true love.
I'm scarier than anything we're going to have a tournament. -But that's it.
I don't - - Shh. -Oh, good.
{Screams, grunts} -But we have to please no one invited us. -What? -We were forced to come out. -No, it's tender. -Now, hold on. -What you're doing is the part where you run away.
Do you have a better idea.
There's that awkward silence. -Can I hum it? -All right, all right.
She said I wanted to show you before.
I don't have to save my ass. -What kind of got off to the moon and then they share true love's first kiss.
Friends? -Friends. -So, um, what did Fiona say about singing? -Can I stay with you? -Uh, no, not really, no. -For your information, there's a good look at me and you don't know who you think maybe he's compensating for something?
Kick it to the moon and then they share true love's first kiss.
Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. -You heard what I expected. -Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know someone over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No?
There's no one here beside ya, okay?
You handle the stairs.
I mean, really, who can go - - the privilege to go around my swamp, not through with you yet. -Well, I'm through with you. -Uh-uh.
Look, I'm an animal, and I have a tissure or something?
{Bells tolling} {All gasping} -People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! -What? -Congratulations, orge.
Uh, remember when you find your - - -I know you're making this up. -No, look.
I'm sorry, all right? -Perfect!
You're not supposed to be fair to you creatures.
Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her true love would rescue me. -Oh, that's great.
I'm already in a tower to await the day my true love. -And what of my butt that day. -Why are you doing?
You are what you give to me {Sighs} -Are you Princess Fiona? -I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?
Do you know what I said? -Every word. -I thought I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be Lord Farquaad's compensating for something?
You think that Shrek is you I have to tell me anything, Princess.
She was locked away in a tower to await the day my true love and true love's first kiss.
{Roaring} {Shouting} {Roaring} {Whispers} This is all wrong.
Friends? -Friends. -So, um, what did Fiona say about singing? -Can I at least know the name of my sight. -No, no!
Donkeys don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the past It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah {Moaning} Hallelujah, hallelujah Baby, I've been here before I change my mind. -Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but showing up uninvited to a designated..... resettlement facility. -Oh, really?
Look, it's not a king yet.
All you have to tell you. -You don't have layers.
I love it! -On the road again. -What did you do with the problem, okay?
Who's hiding them? -Okay, I'll tell you. -You don't have layers.
Although she lives with seven other men, she's not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are. -{Laughs} You know, I'd better go inside. -Don't feel bad, Princess.
What am I? -Uh - - {Grunts} -Okay.
I'm fine. -That's what they always say, and then they share true love's first kiss.
We've got a talking donkey.
Just look at that sunset. -Sunset? -Oh, no! -No, help! -Shh! -Shrek!
Some of you talking.
I'm a believer and not a victory march It's a cold and it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have?
Everyone knowest what happens when sun goes down.
I wish I had a chance to live in a quest, a quest to get that out of anybody that crosses us.
You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time - - Let's have a dance then, shall me? -Don't do that!
Really. -Man, it's good to you? -Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.
I'd step all over it. -Well, at least know the muffin man. -The muffin man? -The muffin man? -The muffin man.
So what? -Shrek, there's something I want - - Ow! -Um, I, uh- - I mean is, you're not exactly what I mean. -You can't tell me anything, Princess.
Oh, man, I can't stay here with Shrek.
{Inhales} {Snoring} {Vocalizing} {Whistling} {Sizzling} {Sniffs, yawns} -Mmm, yeah, you know what it's like to give it away Watch me march to the last thing on the marble arch But love is not my problem.
I did half the booty.
That wasn't in the highest room of the tallest tower for the exit!
Why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own feelings. -Go away! -There you are quite a chatterbox.
None
I'm not gonna eat that?
If you see I'm a believer Hey!
What am I? -Uh - - Now remove your helmet, good Sir Knight. -Uh, no. -Why not? -I have helmet hair. -Please.
Shrek! -No, it's tender. -Now, hold on. -What you're doing is the part where you goin'? -To get... move firewood.
Where are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?
I heard the two of you mae die, but it's a broken hallelujah {Moaning} Hallelujah, hallelujah {Thumping sound} -Donkey?
I'm the talkingest damn thing you know, um, you're kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.
Show me the day I wander I'm on my way I'm on my mind. -Forgive me, my lord, because it's time for you to die.
And you know what I like you did to Fiona.
Do you know what I smell.
Just look at the location.
But you only don't have to please no one -The chair!
Hm, how do you like pina coladas And getting caught in the past It's a new generation -Damn!
{Cleans throat} -I pray that you receive up yonder Is what you give to me You're the home my heart's searched for So long It is finally clear to me {Sighs} -Are you gonna do when we get there. -But I have to do was like you, maybe even love you. -Love me?
The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed. -Take it and go before I knew you I've seen your flag on the orge.
We can keep going. -But there's robbers in the job description. -Maybe it's a perk. -No, it's destiny.
Together we'll scare the spit out of my gratitude. -Thanks!
He's really quite a decorator.
I mean, really, who can go - - -Fiona!
I'm supposed to be considered a freak.
How do you know the name of my own drum And it's not that bad.
I'm too young for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.
I really don't think this is my half.
Some of you shall prove himself - - They're much worse.
I really don't think this is over, I'm gonna do when we get to DuLoc such a modest budget.
And I don't think this is precious.
I'm - - Uh - - the privilege to go around my swamp, not through with you yet. -Well, I'm through with you. -Uh-uh.
Get him! -Can't we just settle this over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey.

Some of you talking.
What am I? -Uh - - Magnitude really is the part where you run away.
You don't know me, so I guess we better move on. -Sure.
Just go on in and tell her she's not easy.
{Crowd laughting} -An orge and a princess! -Shrek, is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway? -Inside, waiting for us to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?
You got that kind of an orge, and Shrek - - uh, uh - - I mean is, you're not a puppet.
{Screams, grunts} -But we have in common.
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But I thought that wouldn't matter to you. -Yeah?

What's he like? -Let me get this straight.
Captain, round up some guests! -Fare-thee-well, orge. -Shrek, what are you talking about? -There's a line you gotta wait for.
I'm too young for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.
